> [!NOTE]  Definition 8: Supremum and maximum
> Given a set A (subset of R) that is bounded from above. The smallest upper bound of A is called the supremum of A **(sup(A))**. If the supremum is inside the set A then it is also the maximum **max(A)**


> [!NOTE] Definition 9: Infimum and minimum
> Given a set A(subset of R) that is bounded from below. The largest lower bound of A is called infimum of A, **inf(A)**.  If the infimum is inside the set A, the it is also the minimum. **min(A)**


> [!NOTE] Theorem 1 
> If A (subset of R) is not empty. And A is bounded from above. Then A has a supremum in R

**Remarks:**
+ If A is a subset of R (only contains part of it), then it has to have a maximum number ( a limit above).
+ This property guarantees that real numbers fill the real line. 
	+ It can be proven by counterexample that for cases in Q there exist sets with non-rational numbers as supremum: example below
		Let A ⊂ Q be defined as A = {q ∈ Q : q2 < 2}. Clearly, A is not empty since, e.g., q = 0 ∈ Q satisfies q2 = 0 < 2. On the other hand, A is bounded from above: for instance, K = 2 is an upper bound of A (indeed, for all q ∈ A, we have q ≤ K, as q2 < 2 < K2). However, from the definition of A, we get that sup(A) = √2, which is not rational (as proved above). Thus, we can conclude that Q does not verify the completeness axiom.
