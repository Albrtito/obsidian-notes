# Well ordered set: 

> [!NOTE] Definition:  
> $(V, \preceq)$ is a **well-ordered set** **IF:**
> +  $(V, \preceq)$ is a total order 
> + **Any nonempty subset of V always has a minimum**

**Remarks:**
+ The set of natural numbers with the usual order (N,$\leq$) is a well-ordered set. This property is **equivalent to**  [[20240602 - 173244 - Method - Principle of induction]]

## The induction principle for well-ordered sets: 

> [!NOTE] Strong induction principle for well-ordered sets:
> Let the set V with an order relation be a well-ordered set and P be some property that satisfies the following conditions: 
> + **Base step:** P($v_0$) is true for $v_0 = min(V)$ 
> + **Inductive step:** Let w be an arbitrary fixed element of V, and let v be its successor. 
> 	+ **IF:** P(x) is true for all $v_0 \preceq x \preceq w$ then P(v) is true.
> 
> **THEN:** P(v) is true foe every v in V.
