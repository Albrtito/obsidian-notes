# Partial differential equations: 
## Intro: 
The partial differential equations involve functions(solutions) depending on 2 (or more) independent variables. $\rightarrow$ They involve partial derivatives
	f.e: $u(x,t)$

+ This equations are usually really difficult to solve analytically, they are usually solved using numerical approaches. 
+ For the differential calculus course weâ€™ll use only one method to solve few examples. ([Separation of variables in solving PDEs](20240418%20-%20193802%20-%20Method%20-%20Separation%20of%20variables.md))
+ The course will discuss three different examples/models
	+ Heat EQ.
	+ Wave EQ.
	+ Potential EQ. (Laplace)
+ **Remark:** All the equations discussed in the models will be linear and second order.
