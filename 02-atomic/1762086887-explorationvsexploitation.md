# exploration vs exploitation
> [!info] Intro: 
> When working with models in unsupervised and reinforced we'll have the model choose the best path to get the better result based on some function. This function can give more importance to either finding the maximum value (**exploitation**) or to just looking for new values to gather data (**exploration**)

Usually an agent will want **to first explore, then exploit**. Look for all the actions that it can do (or as many as possible), then find the best one. 
- Both cannot be done at the same time.
- If the agent explores to much then it'll find to many things that are just not good and waste the time.
