# ridge regression
> [!info] Intro: 
> A regression model that uses regularization based on the magnitude of the parameters. Adding the following expression to the cost calculation:
> $$
> \alpha \sum^D_{j=1}\theta_{j}^2
>$$
> **where:**
> - Thetas are the coefficients
> - Alpha -> Controls how much importance to give to the ridge regression. For alpha = 0 the model will just be a normal linear regression

This type of regression can be used to **reduce overfitting of the regression model**
