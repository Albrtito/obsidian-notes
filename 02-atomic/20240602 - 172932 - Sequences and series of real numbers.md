This note explains two different concepts [Sequences of real numbers](Sequences%20of%20real%20numbers.md) and [Series of real numbers](Series%20of%20real%20numbers) that are related in in the following way: 

**A sequence of real numbers is represented as a list** of real numbers computed based on some natural number n. A valid example would be: 
$$
s_1 = ({1\over n}_{n\in N}) = \{1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4...\}
$$
+ See that for every value of a new term of the sequence is obtained. 
+ n takes natural values, hence $n \in \mathbb{N}$

A series of real numbers on the other side is deeply related with a sequence because it is **the infinite sum of all the sequence**. A series takes the values of the sequence and sums them infinitely.  Of course we can compute this sum until one finite point. Based on the example presented for sequences we would obtain the following series: 
$$
\sum ^\inf_{n=1} ({1\over n_{n\in N}}) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4+.....
$$


When studying sequences and series we'll try to find if they are decreasing, increasing, what values do they take at infinity...
