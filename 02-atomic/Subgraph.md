 A graph $H = (W,F)$ is a subgraph of G= (V,E) if: 
$$
 W \subset = V ; F \subset= E 
$$
 A graph is a [spanning subgraph](spanning%20subgraph) of another one if the set of vertices between the original and this one is the same but the set of edges differs(or is the same):
$$
 W \subset= V: F = E
$$
