# Procotol - IPv6
The IPv6 protocol was created once the IPv4 addresses **started to deplet**, there has been several estimation to when the IPv4 addresses will be completely depleted. The reality is that nowadays all address blocks have been given to the ISPs. So itâ€™s all a mater of time. 

## Datagram format:
![[1731411683 - Procotol - IPv6j.png|center|350]]

This new datagram has several changes, the most important ones are:
+ **Expanded addressing:** Addressing is 128 bits instead of 32
+ **Fixed 40 byte header:** The header is 40 bytes and that doesnt ever change. 
+ ==**Flow labeling:** Different flows of data are labeled to differentiate between applications and services.==
+ **Hop limit:** The TTL field is renamed to Hop LImit. 

> [!attention] Remarks: 
>+ There is no Fragmentation/reassembly anymore
>==+ **No checksum**, there is enough redundancy in the transport and link state protocols. Both of these have reliable transfer==
>+ **Options are no more**
