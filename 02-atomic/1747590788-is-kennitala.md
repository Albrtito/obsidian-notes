# is-kennitala
The kennitala is **the icelantic social security number**, its a must have because the rent has to be done through there and the housing also asks for it. So.. how can I get it?


## After kennitala:
1. Write  bn@bn.is (for RU housing) with your new kennitala
2. After that, you can sign the contract at the BN office in Skeifan 19 (for RU housing)
