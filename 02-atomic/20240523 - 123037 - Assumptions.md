# Assumptions: 

Assumptions are a part of proof theory in propositional logic. During the logic course in UC3M three types of assumptions where seen: 

## Case testing: 
$$\frac{\Gamma, \mathbf{A} \Rightarrow \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\Gamma}, \mathbf{B} \Rightarrow \mathbf{C}}{\boldsymbol{\Gamma}, \mathbf{A} \vee \mathbf{B} \Rightarrow \mathbf{C}}$$
This assumptions states the following: 
+ Given some premises
	+ **IF** Introducing premise A we can get C **AND** Introducing premise B we can get C
	+ **THEN:** WE can get $A\lor B \Rightarrow C$

**Remarks:**
This is usually used once we have $A\lor B$ as a premise because then weâ€™ll be able to use Modus Ponens to get C.
