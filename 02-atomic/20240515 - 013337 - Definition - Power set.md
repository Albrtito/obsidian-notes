**Proof:** Sum all the possible subsets for each of the possible number of elements in the subset. Based on the [[20240515 - 013001 - Theorem - Newton's binomial theorem|Newton's binomial theorem]] when x = 1 and y = 1.

**Remarks:**
+ **Cardinality of the power set:** It is given by the powers of two: 
	$$
	|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}
	$$
