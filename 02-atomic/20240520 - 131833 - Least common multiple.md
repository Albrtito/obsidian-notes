# Least common multiple: 


> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> The **least common multiple** of two natural numbers a,b is the least natural number m such that: 
> + a | m **and** b|m
>   
> Denoted as: **lcm(a,b)**

**Remark:** The lcm exists because the set of natural numbers is a [[20240519 - 172613 - Well-ordered set|Well-ordered set]]

The relation between the least common multiple and the [[20240519 - 214806 - Definition - Greatest common divisor|Greatest common divisor]] is: 
$$
a \cdot b = gcd(a,b) \cdot lcm(a,b)
