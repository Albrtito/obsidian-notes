# Perfect matchings
## Definitions: 

> [!NOTE] Definition of perfect matching: 
> A perfect matching of a simple graph with 2n vertices is a spanning subgraph composed by n disjoint edges. 
> 
> **Namely**: Given a graph, try to make pairs of two vertices such as each pair contains two vertices that are not join by an edge. If you can make pairs and no vertex is left out, nice! U’ve got a perfect matching!


**Remarks:** 
+ The matching is represented as a graph called G. This graph has n disjoint edges. (n pairs of two vertices joined by an edge)
+ All of the vertices must be in the matching 
+ Each vertex is only connected to one other vertex by only one edge. 

**Solving:**
+ When solving perfect matchings, what we are looking for when they ask us: Is there a perfect matching in the graph? Is whether we can arrange or not the graph  in the particular way of a perfect match to create the graph G. (a perfect match). 
	+ They can also ask how many different Gs can we create. (combinatorics)

## Theorems: 

> [!NOTE] Theorem matchings in **bipartite graphs**:
> If G is a bipartite and regular graph with degree d≥ 1, then G contains a perfect matching.
