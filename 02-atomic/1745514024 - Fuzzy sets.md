# Fuzzy sets

In order to define this natural descriptions we need to group large numbers of values that variables can take into sets (fuzzy sets) and create some function that given a value returns the set it belongs to. 

> f.e: Lets define some set A:S → {0,1}
> And now define the value mu based on x that return one of two possibilities wether x belongs to set A or not
>$$
\mu_A(x)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } x \text { is an element of set } A \\ 0 & \text { if } x \text { is not an element of set } A\end{cases}
$$

This method however discriminates to all those values that are **close to be inside a set but are not**.
> If we say that tall is someone with height=1.8m then by this definition anotherone with height = 1.79 meters wont be categorized as tall. 

In order to solve this we’ll adapt the definition of our function mu in order to return not only if the value is or not in the set but with **which probability is the value in the set**
Given some set A:
$$
\mu_A(x) : property(x) \rightarrow [0,1]
$$
+ Mu is a function that given a property of x returns the probability of belonging to group A
+ This function can be of many types, some of them described below. Each type will get a different name based on their type: π and $\mu$ are the main ones?

## π Function:

## Simpler functions:
+ Prefered for computations 
+ Defined piecewise

## Function modifications:
There are some basic function modifications in order to represent the use of adverbs in a subset. 
+ **concentration:** Exponential change of natural numbers (bigger the number bigger the concentration)
+ **dilation:** Exponential of fractional numbers (bigger the denominator, bigger the dilation)

> f.e: In order to represent very tall we could use a concentration: funciton $\mu(x)^2$
