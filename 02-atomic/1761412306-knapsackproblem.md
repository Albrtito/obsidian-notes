# knapsack problem
> [!info] Intro: 
> The knapsack problem is a well known optimization problem that ries to solve for the highest value items that can get into a sack. Each item is given a weight|cost and a value. The whole sack has some max cost that cannot be surpassed.

In order to solve such a problem we could go search in linear programming for sure, maybe SAT and CSP too.
