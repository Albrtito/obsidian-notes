# radix sort
> [!info] Intro: 
> Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that applies several times [[1763604604-bucketsort|bucket sort]] in order to to sort **positive integers** (maybe sometimnes floats, but that requires a trick). 

>[!attention] Remarks:
> - Even faster than MergeSort and Quicksort once the threshold of min number of buckets is reached

The video linked [[#Down|below]] is pretty nice and explains everything super good, I'll try to summarize. 

Bucket sort sorts for n categories, if we then have n positive integers, then there is n categories. So because it first need to go though all integers, then through all buckets. The complexity is O(n+n) = O(2n). If the number of integers to sort is huge (lets say $2^{32}$), then there are to many buckets to loop through. 
The solution here is to half the number of buckets. It is much faster to go through less buckets. 
In order to do so the sorting is done in waves. Starting from the rightest digit. Once this sorting is performed next digit to the left. Repeat until all integers are ordered.
