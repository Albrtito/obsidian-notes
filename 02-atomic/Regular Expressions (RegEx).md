A regular expression is a sequence of letters and symbols that form a search pattern. In addition, regular expressions can be created with patterns called metacharacters. Meta characters are symbols that define the search pattern but have no literal meaning. We can use it in tools like [grep](grep.md) or [sed](sed.md) or others. Often regex is implemented in web applications for the validation of user input.

The main advantage of regex are the [Grouping Operators](Grouping%20Operators.md)
