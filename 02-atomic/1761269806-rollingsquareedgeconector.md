# rollingsquare edge conector
> [!info] Intro: 
> The edge connector is basically a bezel and a magnet. 

It is the solution for the external monitor idea. Something like their [tablet kit](https://rollingsquare.com/products/edge®-pro-tablet-kit)
- Inspiration from [here](https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/26/how-to-overhaul-your-iphone-ipad-and-mac-setup-using-this-clever-magnetic-ecosystem/)

It also lets the monitor rest on this hinges so it can be used as an external monitor ass well as magnetized to things. With a bar of something magnetic a nice stand can even be created.
