# analyzing the residuals of a regression model
> [!info] Intro: 
> When looking into the residuals of a regression model a distribution of them will appear as well as some pattern (when plotting residuals agains the variables). 
> If the model is fitting nicely then the residuals should **have a normal distributtion and no pattern**. Both properties at the same time. If any of the two properties is not checked then it may be that the model is not really good.
