# Uncertainty

>[!NOTE] Intro 
>We say there is uncertainty over some assertion wen we cannot categorize it as true or false. 
+ [[1738764683 - Production systems|Production systems]] have no uncertainty, they habe **absolute certainty**
> f.e: The wheather tomorrow, it wont be either true or false but “raining with some percent chance”

The solutions proposed to this problem are of two types: 
1. We can omit the uncertainty and act as if it was never there. This is what [[1745512462 - Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy logic]] does
2. We can join different results into categories, so that it is either one category or the other
3. We can use [[1745499861 - Probabilities|Probabilities]]. This is what probabilistic reasoning and bayesian networks are all about.
