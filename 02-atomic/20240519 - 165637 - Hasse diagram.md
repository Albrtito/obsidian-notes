# Hasse diagrams: 
An order relation can be represented as a **directed graph** this directed graph can be simplified by removing redundant elements. The simplification we obtain is called a Hasse diagram. 
## How to obtain a Hasse diagram: 
1. Eliminate all loops on each vertex (created from reflexivity)
2. Eliminate all connections created from transitivity:

Connection a - c is deleted as it can be deduced by a - b and b -c 

3. Make it so all the arrows point upwards. All edges point upwards. Then eliminate the arrows.
