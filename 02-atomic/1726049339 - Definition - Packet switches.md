# Packet switches

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> Packet switches are a main component of the network, occupied on retransmitting and sending packets over the whole net. 
> Packet switches are divided into two groups:
> + [[1730624725 - Router|Routers]]
> + **Link-layer switches**
> The difference between these two is stated below. 


> [!ATTENTION] Routers vs link-switches 
> A distinction between the routers and the link-layer switches is really important because **routers make decisions based on the network layer while switches make them based on the link layer**
> + Not to confuse link-switches with packet-switches (these are both routers and link-layer switches) 
> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> Packet switches forward incoming packets towards the next link in the net so that the package may arrive at itâ€™s ultimate destination
