# types of projects based on goal and solution
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Based on the nature of the **solution and goal** of a project we can categorize it as one of four types.
> 

1. **Traditional projects(TMP):** Clar goal and solution
2. **Agile projects(APM):** Clear goal, unclear solution
3. **Extreme projects(xPM):** Unclear everything
4. **Emertxe projects(MPx):** Clear solution unclear goal (this does not make any sense)
