Natural numbers are all whole numbers without the 0. Their properties (that define them) are:
+ Ordered set
+ Adding or multiplying two natural numbers results in another natural number. N is closed under + and . operators.
+ Division and subtraction are external operators. Number obtain may not be natural
+ Usually used in counting or enumerating problems: See #discrete 

> [!NOTE] Definition 1: Factorial
> Let $n \in \N \cup \{0\}$ the factorial of n is given by: 
$$
> n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...3*2*1
$$

**Remarks:**
+ By convention $0! =1$

+ Useful when computing unordered subsets
