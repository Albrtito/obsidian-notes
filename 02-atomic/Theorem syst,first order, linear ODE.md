> [!NOTE] Theorem
> Let $X^1,...,X^n$ be n solutions of a system of first order linear ODEs such that $detX(t) \not = 0$ , for some $t \in I$, where: 
> $$
> X(t) = [x^1|x^2|...|x^n]
> $$
> Then: 
> + $x^1,...,x^n are linearly independent $(\forall t \in I)$ 
> + Each sol. of the system can be written as a linear combination of $x^1,...,x^n$

**Remarks:**
+ $detX(t)$ is called the wronskian of $X^1, ..., X^n$ $\rightarrow$ $W[x^1,...,x^n](t)$
+ The family of sol. given by $c_1x^1+ ...+ c_nx^n (c_1,..., c_n \in \mathbb{R})$ includes **all** sol. of the system. (**general solution**)
+ {$x^1,...,x^n$} is a fundamental set of sol. (in I)
