# Injectivity:

**Also called one to one** : “For each value of x there is one value of f(x) **one x to one f(x)**” 

A function **f: A → B** is injective **if**: 
$$
f(x_1) = f(x_2)
$$
**Implies:**
$$
x_1 = x_2
$$

Trace a horizontal line from any point in B. This line **must intersect the graph AT MOST ONCE**

f.e:
+ A parabola is **not injective**
