# Extrema: 
Extrema are one of the most important things for function analysis. 

Extrema are important point of the function that need to be studied because else we wouldn’t not know what is exactly happening at each of them. 

During #calc we’ll look at extrema mainly in order to search for the [[20240615 - 205544 - Definition - Local maximum and minimum points of a function|Local maximum and minimum points of a function]]. 

## Extrema of a continuous function: 
For f being a continuous function on  \[a,b] the extrema can be categorised in different groups: 

+ **Critical points/values:** Values for $x_0$ such as $f’(x_o) = 0$ are called critical points. While the value of $f(x_0)$ is called critical value. 
+ **End points** : a and b. End points of the interval where the function is defined
+ **The points $x\in [a,b]$**  where the derivative is not defined. 

We **must look at the value for f at each of those points and compare it in order to find the maximums and minimums of the function**
