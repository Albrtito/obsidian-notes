# stationary vs nonstationary reward distribution
> [!info] Intro: 
> Reward distributions for reinforcement learning models or other that use rewards can change with time or keep fixed. 
> If it stays fix then we say that it is **stationary**, if it changes then it is **nonstationary**

The model using this rewards is computing an expected reward for actions. IF the rewards are stationary then this expected reward does not change. However if they are not the expected reward must change over time. Usually giving more weight to **recent rewards over long-past rewards.**
