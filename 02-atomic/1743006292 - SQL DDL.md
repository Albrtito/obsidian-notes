# SQL DDL

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The SQL **Data Definition Language** is the one in charge of implementing all the theory described in the [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics|DB Relational Statics]]. 
> It defines objects using instructions for: 
> + **Creation**
> + **Suppresion/Deletion**
> + **Alteration**

## Creation (CREATE):
THe creation operation is called `CREATE` and can be applied on schemas, tables, views, domains, sequences and any objects that the language has. 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	table_element 
	[, table_element[,...]]
);
```

**Where:**
The table elements are described such as:
```SQL
table_element := {column_def | table_constraint}
column_def := column_name datatype(max_size)
			[column_val]
			[column_constraint]
column_val := {
			DEFAULT value | 
			GENERATED {ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT} AS IDENTITY [(START WITH int [,INCREMENT BY int])]}
```

The constraints of columns and tables are described in the following way, in both cases the constraint must be given a name `<column_constraint_name> | <table_constraint name>`.
```SQL
column_constraint := {[NOT] NULL | PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE | REFERENCES ... | CHECK (...)} [STATE {ENABLE | DISABLE}]
```

```SQL
table_constraint := {PRIMARY KEY (col[,...]) | UNIQUE (col[,...]) | FOREIGN KEY (col[,...]) REFERENCES ... | CHECK (...)} [STATE {ENABLE|DISABLE}]
```

See that the **foreign key table constraint** has more to it than the others as the rules to [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics#Protecting referential integrity|protect referential integrity]] must be applied.
```SQL
FOREIGN KEY (<columns>)
	REFERENCES <table_name>
	[(<columns>)]
		[ON DELETE CASCADE | SET NULL | RESTRICT | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT]
		[ON UPDATE CASCADE | SET NULL | RESTRICT | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT]
```
> **ORACLE:** Only supports
> + **Update:** NO ACTION, by default and cannot be stated
> + **Delete:** NO ACTION by default, also can be set to CASCADE AND SET NULL.


>f.e: A COMPLETE CREATE TABLE STATEMENT
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Course ( 
	subject VARCHAR2(100),
	degree VARCHAR2(50),
	credits NUMBER(2) NOT NULL,
	lecturer VARCHAR2(50),
	CONSTRAINT pk_course PRIMARY KEY(subject, degree,
	),
	CONSTRAINT valid_ttl CHECK (credits>0),
	CONSTRAINT fk_course_degree FOREIGN KEY(degree)REFERENCES degree(name) ); 
	-- SQL is not case sensitive, remember to use snake_case
);
```


**Remarks:**
+ Each table element (besides the first one) starts with a comma. Last one does not have comma at the end
+ See the datatypes in [[#Datatypes]]

## Removal (DROP)
Removal or deletion of elements is done using the `DROP` statement.
```
DROP <element> <name>;
```
Instead of deleting we can just get rid of the data using the `TRUNCATE` statement.
```SQL
TRUNCATE <element> <name>;
```

> f.e: `DROP TABLE example;`

## Amendment (ALTER):
In order to change any constraint or column definition for an object the `ALTER` command is used. 
```SQL
ALTER <element> <name>
	{ADD | ALTER | DROP} <element>
	[<definition>];
```
>f.e:
>+ Here the SELECT is used only to check that the change has been made 
```SQL
ALTER TABLE example ADD (age NUMBER(2)); 
ALTER TABLE example ADD CONSTRAINT max_age CHECK (age<100);
SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME, SEARCH_CONDITION 
	FROM 
		USER_CONSTRAINTS 
	WHERE 
		table_name='example' AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE='C';
```
