# density-based clustering
> [!info] Intro: 
> A clustering approach ased on connectivity and density functions. Clusters are seen as **dense regions** in the data space, separated by regions of **lower density**.

>[!important] Properties:
> 1. **Cluster definition:** Clusters are then defined by a maximal set of density connected points. (The points that when joined create a bound)
> 2. **Cluster forms:** Arbitrarily shaped clusters
