# Proof theory: 
## Intro: 
Proof theory defines mathematically the form that any deductive structure should have. 
## Deductive structures: 
Deductive structures are mathematical definitions that define how must a logic system be in order to be able to create some formal proofs
### Formalisation of deductive structures: 
In order to formalise a deductive structure in proof theory the following elements are needed: 

![Formal demonstration system](20240409%20-%20122918%20-%20Definition%20-%20Test%20System%20S.md)

With these elements a formal proof can be defined as: 
$$
\text{formal proof } = (A,F,X,R)
$$
+ This definition requires for the set of axioms to be consistent. (**A rule and it’s negation cannot be simultaneously proven**)
### Description of a deductive structure: 
A deduction or deductive structure is described by two sequences of s.c.f separated by the symbol “$\Rightarrow$”
$$
p_1, p_2,p_3, p_4,...,p_n \Rightarrow q_1, q_2,q_3,...,q_m
$$
+ Elements p: **Premises**
+ Elements q: **Conclusions** 

#### Correct deductive structures: 
In order for a **deductive structure to be correct** all the elements of the sequence must be either: premises, valid formulas (axioms or theorems), deduced from premises or previous conclusions using the inference rules. 

**Useful theorems:**
+ The [Deduction Theorem](20240409%20-%20132720%20-%20Theorem%20-%20DeductionTheorem.md) defines a relationship between correct deductive structures and valid formulas. 
	
	This theorem is really useful as, in practice, we’ll be able to obtain premises to work with by transforming part of the valid formula stated as conclusion to a premise. (se examples for a better understanding)
## Concept of proof:
What is a proof? Mathematically, obviously.
What is it that we are doing when using the rules of a logical system to obtain a new formula?

We know that when we prove something, we are showing that it is possible to arrive to the conclusions using only the premises, then, formally: 

> [!NOTE] Proof
> A proof of a formula A in the system S is a sequence of formulas p1,p2,p3,…,$p_n$ such that: 
> + Each formula $p_i$ is **either an axiom or a valid formula obtained from the previous ones applying the inference rules**
> + The **last element** of the sequence $p_n$ is the **element to be proven.**
