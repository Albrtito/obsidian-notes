# Inclusion-exclusion principle
The inclusion-exclusion principle is a **generalisation of the special case mentioned in the [[20240515 - 010006 - Principle - Sum principle|Sum principle]]** where sets are not disjoint. (they intersect)

The main idea behind this principle is: **Don't count twice what is repeated**. 

## Base case:
With two sets it is easy to see that:

## Three sets:
In the image above we see that with three sets there are more parts that intersect, this makes it a little more tricky:

## General case:
+ The area shared is removed more or less times that it should, then it is needed to add/subtract those parts.
