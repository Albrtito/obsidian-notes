# Network types
There are several **types and topologies** in networking used to categorise networks. These networks are:

**WAN (Wide Area Network):** Is just a large number of LANs joined together, the clear example is the internet. Large companies may also have internal WANs (Intranets). We detect a wan by looking at its IP Schema aas it should not be withint the values(10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 â†’ These are values for local networks).
+ Uses BGP routing protocol 

**LAN/WLAN (Wireless. Local Area Network)**: Used for local networks, assigns ip addresses within the [[1729160204 - RFC1918 Network Address|RFC1918]]
