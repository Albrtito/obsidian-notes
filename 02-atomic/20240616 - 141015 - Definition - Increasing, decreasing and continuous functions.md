# Increasing, decreasing and continuous functions
Based on the concept of [[20240615 - 195347 - Differentiability|Derivative]] and the study of [[20240615 - 205544 - Definition - Local maximum and minimum points of a function|Local maximum and minimum points]] we define three possible states for any interval of point in a function. 


> [!NOTE]  Definition:
> 1. If f is continuous on (a,b) and f’(x) = 0 for every $x \in (a,b)$. **Then f is constant on (a,b)**
> 2. If f’(x) > 0 for every $x \in (a,b)$. **Then f is strictly increasing** on (a,b). 
>    The derivative is always positive, the slope is always increasing. 
> 3. If f’(x) < 0 for every $x \in (a,b)$. **Then f is strictly decreasing** on (a,b). 
>    The derivative is always negative, the slope is always decreasing. 

**Remarks:**
+ If f’(x) > 0 for every $x \in (a,b)$ and f(a) < 0 < f(b) then, **the equation f(x) = 0** as **an unique solution on that interval**. 
  If it is always increasing (also valid for decreasing), then it can only go through the value for 0 once.
