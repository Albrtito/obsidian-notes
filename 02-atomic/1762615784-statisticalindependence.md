# statistical independence
> [!info] Intro:
> Statistical independence occurs when the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event occurring. Two events A and B are independent if:
> P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

This means the joint probability equals the product of individual probabilities.

Seen from a [[1745501224 - Theorem - Conditional probability|Conditional probability]] perspective. Two variables are statistically independent if **knowing one of them does not affect the probabilty of the other one**

> Independence is:
> • Flipping two fair coins - the outcome of one doesn't affect the other
> • Rolling dice multiple times
> • Drawing cards with replacement

If two variables are not independent then the correlation between them can be mea
