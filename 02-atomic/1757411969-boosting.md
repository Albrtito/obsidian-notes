# boosting
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Want to improve an initially underfitting model. Improving over the instances that where badly classified. **Focus on what went wrong**
> Belogs to the group of methods that divide the test data into different sambles for different models

# Getting the data
The drawing of data is done randomly at first, then when training see which predictions are being badly predicted and add more of those data points to the model for next time.

- Each classifier gets a weight that keeps on changing when more models are created.
	- If we got the classifier wrong, we increase the weight
- THis forces a **sequentiall creation of the model**
