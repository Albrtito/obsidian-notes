A set A (subset of R) is bounded if it is bounded from below and above
It is distinguished between sets that are bounded from above and sets that are bounded from below. 
+ A set is **bounded from above** if there exist a real number K such that for any of  the elements in the set. K is greater than the element. K is called the **upper bound**
+ A set A is **bounded from below** if there exist a real number K such that for any member of the set K is smaller than the specified member. K is called the **lower bound of A**
