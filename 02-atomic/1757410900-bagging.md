# bagging
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Bagging comes from **Bootstrap Aggregation**. This method is used to create an ensemble trained on different data.

- Help reduce variance
- Less susceptible to everfitting with noissy data 
- Robust to minor perturbations in trainig set
# Creation of training data: 
To create the different sets of training data that each model will use the values of the trainig set are taken randombly and with repetition, creating trainig sets of the same original lenght but with repeated values. 

This is called **drawing with replacement**
- **Training can be done in parallel**
