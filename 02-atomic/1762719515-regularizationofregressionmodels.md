# regularization of regression models
> [!info] Intro: 
> Regularization means constraining the model. This is done by adding some new cost to the cost function. The naturaleza of this new cost constrains the model one way of another. 

Some types of regularizations would be:
- Reduction of the polynomial degree to reduce overfitting
- Constraining the weights of the model, such as in [[1762719774-ridgeregression]] or [[1762720091-lassoregression|lasso regression]], also possible to combine both by using [[1762720376-elasticnetinregression|elastic net in regression]]
- Restricting the number of epochs for [[1758734414-gradientdescent|gradient descent]] (early stopping)
