# HTML Classes
HTML clases are attributes we can give to each HTML element in order. 
An example of a class in a div element would be: 
```HTML
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>

```

If we wanted to **add multiple classes to a single element** we could separe them with an space: 
```HTML
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text severe-alert">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
```


+ HTML classes are used for CSS styling.
