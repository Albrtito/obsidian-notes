> [!NOTE] Partition
> For a set S we can create a partition of the set by cutting the set into subsets such as each subset $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^k$  complies with the following properties: 
> 1. $|S_i| = n_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k$
> 2. They are pairwise disjoint: $S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset$ $\forall i \not =j$
> 3. The union of all the partitions is S and the sum of their cardinalities is the cardinality of S

Because there are a lot of things to keep in mind with sets; they are ordered or not, the order of the partitions does not matter inside or outside and a lot more, we have a formula with a few things more than other ones: 
$$
\binom{m}{m_1,m_2}...
$$
