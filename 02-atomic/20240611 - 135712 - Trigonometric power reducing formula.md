# Trigonometric power reducing formula: 
$$
\frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2} = \sin^2 (x)
$$
**Remarks**: 
+ Mainly used to perform conversions when we have something like: $cos(x) - 1$ 
  $$
  cos(x) - 1 = -2sin^2(x/2)
  $$
  
+ **Remember:** The sin is x/2 to agree with the formula. **Do not forget this part**
