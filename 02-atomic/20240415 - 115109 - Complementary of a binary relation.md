> [!NOTE] Definition 125 
> Given a relation R (VxW). We define its complementary relation as $\overline{R}$. The relation on (VxW) that contains **all elements that weren’t related on R**. 
> The formal definition would be: 
> $$
> \overline{R} = (V\times W)/ R = \{(v,w)\in (V\times W) / (v,w)\not \in R\}
> $$ 

**Remark:** 
+  A point belongs to the complementary relation if and only if it doesn’t belong to the relation. 
+ $\{R,\overline{R}\}$ : Is a **partition of VxW**
+ The union of the complementary and the relation is the whole cartesian product.
