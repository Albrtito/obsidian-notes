# Simulation of a threads on-demand server: 
This simulation is done using [Semaphores](20240503%20-%20190310%20-Semaphores%20Dijkstra%20method.md).

**Remarks:**
+ Careful not to cause race conditions

One single thread is created in the main loop. This thread controls all the creation of other threads from that point forwards. This master thread is based on the receiver function.

## Functions: 

**Main:** 
The main function creates the receiver and initialises all the semaphores, etc. It also computes the time it takes the server each request. 

**Receiver:**
This acts as a master thread. It receives all the request and creates threads to manage the received requests. It uses the semaphore sparam to wait for the just created thread to copy the pointer to the request so it can keep using itâ€™s pointer r. 
Finally it uses the semaphore snchildren to check whether a child has finished or not. 

**Service:** 
One thread based on this function is created for each of the requests. It manages and replies the requests in the reply_requests function. It uses the sparam semaphore to let know the receiver that the resource is copied and the snchildren semaphore to let know the receiver that the thread is going to exit. 

## Used library: 
This library contains the reply and receive function as well as an structure for the requests.
