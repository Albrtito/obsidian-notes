> all changes related to the obsidian configuration

### 10/09/2025
Added [expanso](https://espanso.org) to the whole system. In the future snippets that are not related to latex and similar will go into here. 

Added **latex suite** plugin for snippets with latex. Initially it was going to be to fulfill the date snippet but it does not have it (that is why i added espanso)


> [!question] tags
> If i use tags as identifiers i dont need to change names of eac file. So instead of naming protocol files with protocol-name i can just give them the protocol flag. 

Given this, wrt the awesome files, i think it may be better to just create the new tag **awesome** for list of things. Then the tag **moc** will be kept for map of contents. Different as it lists things related with each other in a more concrete way? 
This difference does not convince me jet. 
For now all notes whose purpose is to be a main node are moc's. 

Created the **help** tag for those notes that define services used to obtain help, documentation or similar resources. 

### 10/11/2025
Changed back the "show tab title bar" property on obsidian settings. Without this property turned on it propmts for a name for the file when creating a new note and this clashes with the templater code for naming new notes. 

### 20251023
Added new snippets into latexsuite to manage callouts for dictionaries, properties and remarks. 
Now the following snippets can be used: 
```txt
":dict"
":remark"
":prop
```
Also changed the [[noteTemplate]] so that the into callout is an info callout type instead of a note callout type. 
All info on callouts is in the [obsidian oficial page](https://help.obsidian.md/callouts)

Added an snipped so that i can write doubds and questions as:
```txt
:duda
```

Also added the "where" statement used in math blocks to explain things into the math snippet.

Renamed the meta,atomic and areas folder so they use minus in the first letter. 
Also changed the settings for plugins and obsidian to reflect the change.

Created (claude did) a css snipped called `theme.css` and added it into snippets. 
- **Red for links ->** Following the setup used in written notes
- **Blue for bold ->** Cause is the other color that looks nice and also makes sense. 

Found out that the vault is not being saved to git. Recreate the git and start new. No worries for version control right now.
