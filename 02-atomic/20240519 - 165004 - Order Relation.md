# Order relation: 
> [!NOTE] Definition:
> A binary relation on a set V is a partial order(or an order relation) **IF:**
> + It it reflexive:  [[20240415 - 123128 - Reflexivity property|Reflexivity]]
> + It is antisymmetric: [[20240423 - 180447 - Property -Antisymmetry|Antisymmetry property]]
> + It is transitive: [[20240415 - 123134 - Transitivity property|Transitivity]]

**Remark:**
+ Order relations are **denoted by:** $\preceq$ 
+ A **partially ordered set $(V,\preceq)$** is a set equipped with an order relation
+ In a partially ordered set two elements are **comparable** if either $a \preceq b$ or $b\preceq a$ . Else they are **incomparable**
+ **IF:** any elements a and b of V are comparable then the set is **totally ordered**, also called **linear order or chain**
	+ The Hasse graph of a totally ordered set is an straight line.

## Extremal elements: 
Reminds of: [[Subsets of  R, Bounds, Supremum, mÃ¡ximum, infimum, minimum]]
### Maximal, minimal
The extremal elements of an order relation are those such as there is no element above or below them are called **maximal and minimal elements** 
+ **Maximal element:** An element such as there is no element above it. 
+ **Minimal element:** An element such as there is no element below it. 

### Maximum, minimum
The elements such as no element is greater or smaller than them are called **maximum(or greatest)** and **minimum(or least)**. Denoted by **max(V)** and **min(V)**. 


**Remarks:**
+ These elements my not exist
+ The maximum element M of a partially ordered set A, if it exists, is **unique**. 
+ The maximum, if it exists, is also the maximal.

### Upper and lower bounds: 

**Remark:**
+ All subsets of a partially ordered set inherit the order

For a subset of a partially ordered set A, the set of all elements in A such as they are greater than any element in B is called the **major(B)**. The least of these upper elements is called the **sup(B)= min(mayor(B))**

By the same logic, the set of elements in A such as they are smaller or equal than any element in B is denoted as  **minor(B)** where any element in that set is called a **lower bound of B**. The maximum element in the minor(B) is called the **infimum**: **inf(B) = max(minor(B))**

**Remark.**
+ It may happen that the major and minor sets are empty and no supremum or infimum exists. 

### Practice applications: 
In practice, these concepts can be detected from the Hasse graph in the following ways: 

**Maximals**: Those nodes that have no edges from them to another node. (No outgoing edges). (remember than with Hasse graphs, even if the arrows are not drawn the edges are directed)

**Minimals:** Those nodes with **no incoming edges** 

**Maximum:** A node such as it **is a maximal** and no other node is also a maximal
**Minimum:** A node such as it **is a minimal** and no other node is a minimal.
## Compatibility of a total order with a partial order relation: 


> [!NOTE] Def: Compatible relations 
> A total order relation on set V is **compatible** with a partial order relation on set V. 
> **IF:** 
> $$
> \forall v, w \in V, v\preceq_P w \Rightarrow v \preceq_T w
> $$

**Remark:**
+ The Hasse graph of a totally ordered set is an straight line.
