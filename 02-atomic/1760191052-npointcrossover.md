# n point crossover
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The n point crossover is a recombination technicque used for evolutionary algorithms where the genome is cut in severl places (n places) and recombined based on those cuts. 

This operator partially solves the problems that appear with 1 point crossovers. 
1. There is less bias, for higher n the things stay together less. 
2. We can choose whether we keep what parts the same of one of the parents.
