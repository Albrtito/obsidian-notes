# Protocol - TDMA

> [!NOTE] Def: 
>  The TDMA protocol is a channel partitioning protocol for the link layer of the network stack. It divides the link medium into multiple time slots. 
## Pros and Cons:
+ Same as all partition channel protocols.
+ **CON:** Needs a synchronisation of all hosts connected in order to divide time slots.
