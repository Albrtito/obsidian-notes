# Fuzzy rules
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Fuzy rules dictate how operations between [[1745514024 - Fuzzy sets|Fuzzy sets]] are made.
> 

## Set operations:

> [!NOTE] How to use them? 
> We use operators as the subjects and verbs of fuzzy logic. We also use the IF-THEN to set rules:
> 

>f.e: *if X is A then Y is B* 
>$$
f(x)= \begin{cases}
Y = B & \text { if } x \text {  equals } A \\
\end{cases}
$$

To operate between the sets we can use:
+ **OR:** Max value between the two functions for a given value of x:
$$
  \mu_A(x) \vee \mu_B(x)=\max \left(\mu_A(x), \mu_B(x)\right)
$$
+ **AND:** Minimum value between two functions for a given value of x:
$$
\mu_A(x) \vee \mu_B(x)=\max \left(\mu_A(x), \mu_B(x)\right)
$$
+ **NOT:** set complement, 1 minus the value obtained
$$
\lnot \mu_A(x)= 1 - \mu_A(x)
$$

## Boolean logic

> [!NOTE] Logical rules 
> While in propositional logic if p â†’ q would mean that if p is true then q is true, in fuzzy logic we need to take into account the probabilities: 
> + If p is true **to some degree** then q **is true to some degree**
