# Def - Function: 

> [!NOTE] Definition: Function
> A function is **a rule** creates a relation between the points of a certain set A to another set B. This is notated as: 
> $$ f: A \rightarrow B$$
> With f(e) being the value of the function f taking element e (from A)

## Properties: 
+ The **domain of f** is: The **set of points where the function is defined** Namely, possible elements that can be taken from A
$$
Dom(f)
$$

+ The **image** of f is defined as: 
$$
Img(f) = \{f(e):e\in Dom(f)\}
$$
Outputs of the function for the possible values in the domain. 

When working with **2 dimensional** functions we define the concept of graph:

+ The **graph** of f is the set of points:
$$
\{(x,f(x)):x\in Dom(f)\}
$$
