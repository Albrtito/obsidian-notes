# lasso regression
> [!info] Intro: 
> Lasso named after: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
> Lasso regression restricts the regression model by performing both regularization and variable selection. It brings some of the coefficients to exaclty zero. Adding to the cost function:
> $$\alpha \sum^D_{j=1}|\theta_{j}|$$
> **where:**
> - Alpha -> Controls how much lasso regularization is applied

>[!attention] Remarks:
> - Assumes that the coefficients of the linear model are sparse
