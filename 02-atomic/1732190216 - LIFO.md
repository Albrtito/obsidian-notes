# LIFO

The concept of the **LIFO** sytem is the following. If we imagine a lot of pieces one on top of the other. We create a tower of pieces. LIFO system creates the tower by adding pieces on the top. In this imaginary tower obviously we canÂ´t get elements that are not on top as the tower could fall. So we allways need to get the element on top if we want to remove any element

In order to perform this operations in code we use the `push` and `pop` methods.
