# Circuit switcing

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> Circuit switching allocates resources to one connection, locking those resources so that no one else can use them. 
> 

> f.e: This is the case of the telephone network, once one is using a cable, no one else can. 

## Multiplexing: 
Allocating resources is not very good for performance, very fast all resources will be allocated andâ€¦ bankrupcy! Multiplexing kind of solves that. 
**It triest to fit several users into one single connection**, there are two ways of doing so:
1. **Frequency division (FDM)** Tranmission on different electromagnetic frequencies

2. ==**Time division multiplexin (TDM):** Slots, quick switching between users with a given pattern.==
