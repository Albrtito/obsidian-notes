# Theorem-Bayes rule
> [!NOTE] Theorem: 
> The Bayes rule theorem is obtained from the [[1745501224 - Theorem - Conditional probability|Conditional probability]] theorem and the [[1745503400 - Probability product rule|Probability product rule]]. Combined we obtain:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
