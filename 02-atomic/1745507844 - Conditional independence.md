# Conditional independence
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Two variables are conditionally indpendent given some variable when knowing one of them does not affect the other one

> f.e: If X and Y are conditionally independent given Z:
> $$
 P(X,Y|Z) = P(X|Z)P(Y|Z)
 $$
> + **Remember:** P(A)P(B) = P(A) + P(B)
>   
>  Also:
>  $$
	P(X|Y,Z) = P(X|Z)
  $$
