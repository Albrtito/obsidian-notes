# Bolzano theorem:
This theorem is kind of a duh once explained. It is basically saying that if two points up and down from the y = 0 horizontal line are inside a continuity interval, then there must be a point where the line is crossed. 

This theorem also has applications when we wanna prove that the function crosses any point in between. 

> [!NOTE] Bolzano Theorem: 
> If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a)f(b) < 0 (meaning one of them is negative). 
> 
> Then there exist a point c $\in (a,b)$ such that: $f(c) = 0$
+ There can be more than one point c. This theorem ensures that there exists **at leats one point**x
## Remarks:
+ The continuity in a **closed interval** is needed.
  
+ As mentioned above, we obtain a new consequences described as theorems: The **intermediate values theorem or the boundedness theorem**
### Intermediate values:
> [!NOTE] Intermediate values theorem:
> If f is continuous and follows the Bolzano theorem. Then for any $y \in (f(a), f(b))$ there exists c$\in (a,b)$ such that f(c) = y. This means that if we have the continuity, then all values of y between those need to appear. This is both valid with  (a > 0 and b < 0) and (a < 0 and b > 0)

### Boundedness:

> [!NOTE] Boundedness:  
> If f is continuous on [a,b]. Then **it is bounded** above and below on [a,b].
