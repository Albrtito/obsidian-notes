# reinforcement learning
> [!info] Intro: 
> Reinforcement learning is agent oriented learning. This means that there is an agent that can interact with an enviroment in order to achieve a goal. 


This creates three basic relations. 
- The Agent performs **actions** to interact with the enviroment
- The enviroment **changes** and with it its **state** based on the agents actions
- The enviroment **rewards** the agent based on their actions and how good they where. 
  - Reward design is important as the agent will get better on what gets the greatest reward. 

>[!example]- Dictionary:
> - **agent ->** The person or object doing the learning
> - **action ->** What the agent can do to interact with the enviroment. Something that the agent does
> - **enviroment ->** The setting the agent learns in
> - **state ->** A collection of properties that the enviroment has at some given moment
> - **reward ->** Positive or negative (**penalty**) based on the actions of the agent. Marking if they where good or not. Rewards are **inmediate**

>[!important] Properties:
> - **Realistic learning:** This type of learning is more realistic than others as the actions and consecuences are similar to the real world
