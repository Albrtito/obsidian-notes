# Inference
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Inference is a solving method that uses [[1745501224 - Theorem - Conditional probability|Conditional probability]] in order to compute posterior distribution given some evidence. 

**Namely:** Use whatever knowledge we have (o) to compute the probability of something happening(X) (the [[1745501051 - Conditional distribution|Conditional distribution]])
$$
P(X|o)
$$
+ We’ll ask for the probability of the whole distribution with an expression such as the latter. For the probability of X taking some exact value we’ll ask such as:
$$
P(X=i|o)
$$
	+ Probability of $X=i : i \in \Omega(X)$ knowing o

We can use this solving method for different cases such as:
## Classification:

P(Class = n | o)
