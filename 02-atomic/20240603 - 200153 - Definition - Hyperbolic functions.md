# Hyperbolic functions:

Based on the definition of [[20240603 - 180502 - Definition - Exponential function|Exponential function]] we can define the hyperbolic functions as follows: 

**Note:**
+ This functions are called sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent because they are related to the trigonometric functions. (See below)

1. **Hyperbolic sine:**
$$
\sinh x = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}
$$
2. **Hyperbolic cosine** 
$$
\cosh x = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}
$$
3. **Hyperbolic tangent:**
$$
\text{tgh } x = \frac{\sinh x}{\cosh x}
$$
4. **Hyperbolic cotangent:**
$$
\coth x = \frac{\cosh x}{\sinh x}
$$
## Properties:
l
+ These functions are **not periodic**
### Relation to trigonometry:
Some properties are also satisfied: 
$$
\cosh^2 x - \sinh^2 x = 1
$$
