# Exponential Differential equation. 

One of the most important DEs there is is the growth/decay exponential DE. 
This equation is has the following form: 
$$
y' = ay
$$
This means: 
$$
\text{The rate of change of y is proportional to y}
$$
The solution for any a for these types of equations is: 
$$
y(t) = Ce^{at}
$$
We can see that this is true by comparing both expressions: 
$$
\begin{gather}
y' = ay \\
y' = Cae^{at}\\
y' = a(Ce^{at})\\
\end{gather}
$$
Then the expression holds for any C (constant). 

The importance of this equation is huge in DiffCalc because of the immediate solution we can obtain. Weâ€™ll see that there are several arithmetic solutions that are based on this proof. 

Lastly: This equation models one of two things, based on the value of a: 
+ a > 0: **Exponential growth**
+ a < 0: **Exponential decay**
