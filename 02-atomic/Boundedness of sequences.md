When all terms of a sequence of real numbers constitute a set in R we can say that the **sequence is bounded**.  The definition of a bounded set was already explained on [Boundedness](Boundedness.md), this can be of some use.

![00000000 - 000000 - Definition - Sequence NOT BOUNDED from above or below](00000000%20-%20000000%20-%20Definition%20-%20Sequence%20NOT%20BOUNDED%20from%20above%20or%20below.md)
