# Definition:

![Definition 122](20240415%20-%20110638%20-%20Definition%20122%20-%20Binary%20Relations.md)

# Representation of a relation: 
In order to represent a binary relation there are several **equivalent** methods: 
+ Use the expression (see definition above)
+ List of elements. 
	f.e: For a two dimensional relation list the points in the relation 
+ Use a Venn’s diagram (arrows)
+ [Binary R. Adjacency matrix](20240415%20-%20111928%20-Adjacency%20matrix%20of%20a%20binary%20relation.md)
+ Cartesian (painting it as points → What if it’s not two dimensional?)
## When in the relation $V = W$: 
If the relation is between elements of the same set (see [](20240415%20-%20110638%20-%20Definition%20122%20-%20Binary%20Relations.md#^420fb6|%20Binary%20relations%20on%20one%20set) the , then we can represent it **as a graph** as it’s adjacency matrix can be seen as the one form a graph.
+ The directions of the arrows matter (as it states the difference between the relation (x, y) and (y, x))
+ The graph only has one copy of V

# Types of binary relations: 
Once defined the basic concept of a relation we can specify between different types of relations based on the properties of each of them. 
For the discrete math course in UC3M we’ll be seeing only equivalence relations.
