What is probability?

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Probability can be seen as:
> 1. Measure of proportion of times something is true
> 2. Measure of degree of belief. How sure someone is about something
>    
> Whichever system, itâ€™ll be allways measured in **a range from 0.00 to 1.00** where 0 is false and 1 is true.
