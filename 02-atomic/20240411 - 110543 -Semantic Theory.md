# Semantic theory: 
While defining propositional and predicate calculus we have always worked with formulas, axioms, inference rules, etc. We work with the generalisation of the formula. 

However in semantic theory we’ll focus on the meaning of propositions(truth values), whether a proposition or a predicate is true or is false and how that affects the formula. 

The symbolisation is the same as the model is the same (propositional or predicate calculus)

We have been working with **only true or false sentences** for the logic course, this are **the only ones inside the scope of the course**. Then: 

Propositions and predicates can be either: 
+ **TRUE / 1**
+ **FALSE / 0**

The following note has all basic information and definitions of semantic theory, for more specification towards predicate or propositional calculus see: 

+ [Semantic theory in Predicates](20240411%20-%20110836%20-Semantic%20theory%20in%20Predicates.md) 
+ [Semantic theory in propositions](20240508%20-%20121510%20-%20Semantic%20theory%20in%20Propositions.md)
## Deductions: 
Deductive structures can also be analysed with truth tables: 


> [!NOTE] Definition:
> A deductive structure is semantically correct if there is no interpretation that makes the premises true and the conclusion false.

+ If there exist an interpretation where the premises are false ant the conclusion true → The deduction does not hold. 

f.e: 
	$$
	 A \rightarrow B, B \rightarrow C \Rightarrow C \rightarrow A
	$$

	Here we can see an **incorrect deduction**. There are possible combinations where the premises are true **but the conclusion is false**

Because we can apply the [Deduction Theorem](20240409%20-%20132720%20-%20Theorem%20-%20DeductionTheorem.md) we know that for deduction: 
$$
p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \Rightarrow q
$$
If we prove: 
$$
p_1\rightarrow(p_2\rightarrow(p_3\rightarrow...(p_n\rightarrow q)...)
$$
The deduction is equivalent and we are also proving the deduction. 


**Remarks:** 
+ By means of  semantic theory we can verify whether a deduction is correct. We cannot prove its correction.
+ If a deduction is correct, it’s associated formula( by deduction theorem) is a tautology

There are two ways of verifying whether a deduction is correct or not. We can use the **direct approach with truth tables (compute the whole truth table)** or the **counterexample approach looking for an specific interpretation of the formula**

+ The first approach: use [[#Truth tables]]

+ For the second approach: use [[#Counterexamples]] 


## Truth tables: 
A truth table of a formula evaluates **ll possible evaluation scenarios / interpretations**  of the formula.
f.e: 
	If there was a formula such as $p \lor q$ it could be such as p is true and q is not, then the formula would be true as p or q means either p is true or q is true, if any of them are then the formula is true. 

For each connective there is a truth table that defines the relation: 

**Negation:**
![Truth table of the negation connective](../99%20-%20Meta/0.%20Attachments/Truth%20table%20of%20the%20negation%20connective.png)

**AND (Conjunction)**
![AND (Conjunction) Truth table](Conjunction)%20Truth%20table)%20Truth%20table.png)

**OR (Disjunction)**
![OR(Disjunction) truth table](Disjunction)%20truth%20table)%20truth%20table.png)

**Conditional:**
![Conditional Truth table](../99%20-%20Meta/0.%20Attachments/Conditional%20Truth%20table.png)

### Solving with truth tables
With this four tables we can obtain the truth table of any formula:


f.e: (an example with propositions)
Verifying if the following is valid using a truth table
$$
   p \land ((p\lor q\rightarrow r)\rightarrow(p\rightarrow r))
$$
+ asterisk → Represents the whole formula
**Truth table**

![Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 11.30.16](../99%20-%20Meta/0.%20Attachments/Screenshot%202024-05-08%20at%2011.30.16.png)

Once we interpret the truth table we can see that for each of the possible combinations the whole formula may be true or false. 

**Remark:** To create all the possible combinations just write all binary numbers from 0 to $2^n$ where n is the number of propositions. 

+ Each combination resulting in a **true value** will be called **model**
+ Each combination resulting in a **false value** will be called **counterexample**

Based on the example presented above. There would be 4 models (the last four rows) and 4 counter-models (the first four rows)

### Analysis of the truth table results:
Based on the solutions to all possible combinations of the formula we can obtain different conclusions from the truth table: 

+ **Tautology:** If all combinations output true
+ **Contradiction:** If all combinations output false
+ **Contingency:** If we get some true and some false values
	+ Like the example above

We say that a formula is **satisfiable** if it is true for at least one interpretation. 
We say that a formula **without counterexamples is semantically valid. Namely: A tautology is semantically valid**


## Counterexamples: 
Counterexamples have the following Idea behind. What if instead of doing the whole truth table we just look for a certain case? For big enough formulas with a lot of different values and possibilities making truth tables can be long and arduous. It only takes one false row for a formula not to be valid(not a tautology), let’s look instead for just that row. 

As we are obtaining formulas from deductions, and if not, it is the same, we’ll usually have some conditional. 
$$
A \rightarrow B
$$
+ Where A and B are syntactically correct formulas

If we want to prove that there exist a **possibility where the formula is false** then looking at the [Conditional Truth table](../99%20-%20Meta/0.%20Attachments/Conditional%20Truth%20table.png) we see that there is only one possibility. If B is false but A is true.
We’ll then look for possibilities in order for that to happen. 

**Remark:** The main way of learning and understanding counterexamples is to either look at the examples given during the logic course or do the exercises.
