# sum of squared error function
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> This is a loss function that performs a direct calculation of the difference between the expected and obtained values. 

$$
J(w) = \frac{1}{2} \sum^N_{n=1}(\hat y_n - y_n)^2
$$
where:
- $\hat y$ â†’ Expected value
- The whole sum is mul by 1/2 for easier computations with its derivatives.
