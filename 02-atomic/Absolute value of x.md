### Definition: 
The absolute value of a variable x that is a real number is: 
$$
|x|=\sqrt{x^2}=\left\{\begin{aligned}
-x & \text { if } x<0 \\
0 & \text { if } x=0 \\
x & \text { if } x>0 .
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

This means the following: 
+ Whenever the variable x is less than 0. The result of the absolute value will be the oposite of x, making x positive
+ Whenever x = 0. Just keep the 0
+ If x is bigger than 0. Keep x

The absolute value for the subtraction of two values x and y outputs the distance there is between them (in the real line).  
### Properties: 
$$
\begin{gather}
 |x|^2=x^2 \\\\
 
 |x|=|-x|  \\\\
 
 |x y|=|x||y| \\\\
 
 -|x| \leq x \leq|x| \\\\
 
 |x| \leq a \Longleftrightarrow-a \leq x \leq a \quad\\(\text { for all } a>0)  \\\\
 
 |x| \geq a \Longleftrightarrow x \leq-a \text { or } x \geq a \quad \\ \text { (for all } a>0) \\\\
 
 |x+y| \leq|x|+|y| \quad \\ \text { (triangular inequality)} \\\\
 
 |x|-|y| \leq|x-y| \leq|x|+|y|
\end{gather}
$$

1. It is the same to have an absolute value squared than the variable squared
2. Don't care about signs
3. Important property about the ranges of x.
