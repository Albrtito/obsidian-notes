# canvas-based learning
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Canvas-based learning uses canvases to gather information and organise it via unconventional methods such as stickers, post-its, images. 
> Info gets ordered into groups (close things relate to each other). 

 **I see the usefullness in the group work that can be done using this methods, as it facilitates the addition of information by everyone at the same time**
