> [!NOTE] Def: 
> + A recurrence relation is of order k is such as it needs k elements for it's initial conditions (next point is the same thing but with a more technical explanation)
> + A recurrence relation is of order k-th if $a_n$ can be expressed in terms of k terms (k initial conditions)
> + A recurrence relation is **linear** if it expresses $a_n$ as a linear function of it's previous terms in the sequence (linear function: Nothing to the power or nothing, just powers of 1)
> + A recurrence relation is **homogeneous** if the independent term is equal to 0. If when substituting every term of $a_{n-k} : \forall k$ for 0 then the equality complies.
