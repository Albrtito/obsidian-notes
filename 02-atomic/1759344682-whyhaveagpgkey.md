# why have a GPG key
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> When looking at researchers and developers and can't help to notice that there is a lot of them that share their GPG key or link to a file with it, why is that? 

A GPG key is used to **sign commits**. It provides authenticity, integrity and security to git commits or any file signed with it. 
This means that if someone shares their GPG public key then anyone can check any contribution to know if it really came from him or if it was tampered with somehow. 

Because this public key is used to check for the CIA triad in code generated by the owner he/she will try and put it out in as many places as possible.
