# matplotlib
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) is a python plotting library. A lot of functions and ways of creating plots, however the basic idea would be:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# populate x with values
x = []
# populate y with values creating points to plot
y = [] # len(y) == len(x)
# create a plot with points defined by x-y pairs
plt.plot(x,y)
```
