# Graph theory:
Graph theory studies graphs. A graph contains a set of vertices linked by some edges. Each edge can link two vertices. 

Graphs can be of many types, at first we’ll **divide between directed and undirected graphs** where directed graphs are those where the direction of the edge doesn’t matter, namely, for this graphs it is the same A → B that A ← B and we just don’t write the arrow or write it both sides (A - B / A ← → B). Where in **directed graphs** this difference matters. 
## Undirected graphs:
The basic definition of an undirected graph is given by the definition of a Pseudograph:
