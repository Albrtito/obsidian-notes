> [!NOTE] Theorem
> Sometimes when looking at the [Monotonicity of sequences](Monotonicity%20of%20sequences.md) and [Boundedness of sequences](Boundedness%20of%20sequences.md) we can obtain wether or not they are [Convergence of sequences](Convergence%20of%20sequences.md). 
> This cases are two and the following: 
> 
> 1. **Conditions:**
> 	1. The sequence is monotone increasing 
> 	2. Sequence is bounded from above
> 	
> **Consequences:**
> The sequence is convergent
> 
> 2. **Conditions:**
> 	1. The sequences is monotone decreasing
> 	2. The sequences is bounded from below
> 
> **Consequences:**
> The sequences is convergent
> 
> We can conclude the following: If the sequences is growing or decreasing, and we also know that there is a bound that it'll encounter sometime. Then the sequences has to reach values towards that bound when it tends to infinity. And **then converge in that bound.**
