# The routing funtion of the network layer

> [!NOTE] Routing: 
> Network wide process that **determines the end to end paths that packets take**
+ Takes place in **longer timescales** (seconds). Only needs to be done every time a new node is added to the network. 
	+ Take into account that nowadays not many nodes have acces directly to the router as only the ISP can acces it.
