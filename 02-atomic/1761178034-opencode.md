# opencode
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> [opencode](https://opencode.ai) its an **AI CODING AGENT**, which basically means that it takes some model you have access to (with an API key for example) and has a lot of tools to work with it. Tools such as connections to other services via [[1761177482-modelcontextprotocol|MCP]]. 

- There is an nvim plugin: [opencode.nvim](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim)
The other thing looking nice is [zen](https://opencode.ai/zen), a system with access to all models that pays per token to each model. So a broker between the models and the user. It is also non-profit.
