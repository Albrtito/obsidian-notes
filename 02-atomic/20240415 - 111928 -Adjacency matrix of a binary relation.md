The adjacency matrix $A_R$ related to a relation (R$\subset V\times W$) denotes the connections between the elements of V and W. In order to create this matrix, columns are the elements of W and files the elements of V. Then for each place in the matrix if the element of V is related to that particular element of W a 1 is placed. Else a 0.
