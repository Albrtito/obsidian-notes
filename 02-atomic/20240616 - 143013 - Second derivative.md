# Second derivative: 
The second derivative of a function is obtained by applying [[20240615 - 195347 - Differentiability|Differentiability of a function]] twice. The function obtained outputs the slope of the first derivative for any value of x.
This derivative is notated as: 
**Newtons’s notation**
$$
f''(x)
$$
**Leibniz’s notation**
$$
 \frac{d^{2}f(x)}{dx}
$$

The main use we give this second derivative in calculus is the **analysis of convexity of a function.** 

+ If the second derivative is positive → convex
+ If the second derivative is negative → concave
