This is the first command that really starts to be used with elements and the idea of components in sql starts to show. It can be used for tables but also for columns in the tables. 
### Using drop: 
```sql
drop <element> <name>; 
```
### Using truncate: 
(Just to get rid of data?? #duda )
```sql
truncate <element> <name>; 
```
