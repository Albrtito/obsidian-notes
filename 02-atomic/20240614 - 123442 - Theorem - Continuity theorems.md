# Continuity theorems: 
This note collects theorems related to continuity, from basic properties to theorems such as Bolzano’s: 


> [!NOTE] Composition 
> If g is continuous at $x_0$ and f is continuous at $g(x_0)$ then: 
> $$
> f \circ g
> $$ 
> Is **continuous at $x_0$**
> 


> [!NOTE] Sign:
> If a function f is continuous at some point, then it …

## Maximum and Minimum: 

> [!NOTE] Max/Min 
> If f is continuous on [a,b] then: 
> + Exist a **max** and a **min** point of f on [a,b] such as: 
>   $$
>   \begin{gather}
>   \exists c,d \in [a,b]\\\\
>    f(c) \leq f(d) \leq(f(d)\\\\
>     \forall x \in [a,b])
>   \end{gather}
>   $$
