# production rules
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The production rules or derivation rules of a grammar define the changes that can be applied to non-terminal symbols for some given grammar.

- A production rule has a left and a right side
  $$ \text{left} \rightarrow \text{right}$$
	- All but lambda can be in the left side

- Production rules can use logical operators, the one seen the most beeing the | to secuentially define several rules.
  > The rule $u\rightarrow v | u \rightarrow w$ means the same as the two rules: $u\rightarrow v$ and $u\rightarrow w$
