# Use of probabilities in AI
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> In AI we use [[1745499861 - Probabilities|Probabilities]] in order to resolve the problems caused by [[1745499420 - Uncertainty|Uncertainty]]. 

Some key aspects of the usage of probabilities in AI are: 
+ **Use the [[1745503400 - Probability product rule|Probability product rule]] recursively to compute joint probabilities only using conditional probabilities**
+ Use of [[1745503976 - Inference|Inference]] in order to classify or obtain the probability of something based on some evidence. 
+ Use of [[1745507844 - Conditional independence|Conditional independence]] in order to **reduce the number of variables and make the process more EFFICIENT**. 
	+ This conditional independence is what makes [[1745508118 - Bayesian network|Bayesian network]]s work and the [[1745510100 - Bayesian inference|Bayesian inference]] related to them 
+ In order to **add the notion of time** to the
