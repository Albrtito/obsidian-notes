## AI:
Currently I'm experimenting with AI using [opencode](https://opencode.ai). The [[AGENTS]] file tries to define some rules for agents to consider when creating new notes. This has not worked so far (agents won't always follow the rules).

I'm not sure about how I want to use AI inside my personal notes. I do know that I want it's actions to be super restricted so that no AI goes into my personal collection of notes.
