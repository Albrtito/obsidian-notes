f.e: 
	If we had 5 elements then we’ll see all the possibilities of combinations of the 5 elements: 
	$$
	5(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4) = 5!
	$$

**Remarks:**

+ **Permutations with repetitions:** 

  Are those permutations where there **can be repetitions**, namely, two elements can be equal, then **the combinations where those elements are switched are counted as equal** and we need to discard them. 
  
  Those repeated arrangements have to be deleted. 
  To delete the repeated arrangements divide by the number of those repeated arrangements. The number is computed as a normal permutations (with the factorial). The final formula is: 
$$
  \binom{n!}{n_1!...n_k!} = {n! \over n_1!...n_k! }
$$
