# ADT - Graf 

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The Graf data structure uses the formal definition of a [[20240515 - 021923 - Definition - Pseudograph|Pseudograph]] and can implement and reflect theorems and transformations collected and studied under the  [[20240515 - 020755 - Graph theory|Graph theory]] area  of mathematics.
> 
> This note however focuses on the implementation of a graph as a **non linear abstract data type**. 
> 
> We’ll still use the formal definition:
>$$
>G = (V, E, \gamma)
>$$
>$$
>\gamma: E\rightarrow \{\{u,v\}: u,v \in V\}
>$$
>For an implementation this means that: 
>+ A set of vertices is needed
>+ A set of edges is needed
>+ Some function that creates the edges is needed. This function may be a manual addition of the edges or an automatic computation of them based on some rules. 
## Properties: 
We’ll focus in  **only some of the properties**, the ones we care about for the implementation. 
### Multiple edges: 
A multiple edge is one such as **if it were deleted there would still be a direct connection between the two nodes it connected.** 
+ If a graph **has multiple edges** → **Multigraph**
+ If a graph **does not have multiple edges** → Simple graph

In general, simple graphs are easier and the way to go when implementing anything. 
### Weighted edges: 
The edges of a graph **may or may not have a weight**. 
+ If there is no weight then it is an **unweighted graph** (same as assuming all edges have the same weight)
+ If there are different weights for each edge then it is a **weighted graph**. 
### Edge direction: 
The edges of a grah **may or may not have a direction**.  
+ **Directed graph:** Graphs with directions 
+ **Undirected graphs**: Graphs without them

> [!NOTE] Def: Direction 
> An unidirectional link means that the defined path goes from A → B but not from B → A.  
> + A directed graph may have edges that go both ways. (bidirectional)
### Density: 
The density of a graph is defined based on the **relation between the number of edges and vertices**. However the **number of vertices is usually used**. 
+ **Dense:** More vertices
+ **Sparse:** Less vertices

## Implementations: 
### Using adjacency matrices: 
+ Used when the graf is **dense**

### Using dictionaries: 
+ Used when the graf is **sparse**

## Graph traversals:
+ Breath-first traversal → Based on [[1732112181 - Algorithm - Primero en amplitud|Algorithm - Primero en amplitud]]
+ Depth-first traversal  → Based on [[1732114607-primeroenprofundidad|Algorithm - Primero en profundidad]]
