# Trigonometric functions:
## sin / cos:
There are two main trigonometric functions, all other can be derived from these ones. 
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x) = sin(x)\\
and\\
f(x) = cos (x)
\end{gather}
$$

+ Arguments from this functions are always given **in radians**. 
**Remarks:**
+ **Dom(sin x) = R**
+ **Dom(cos x) = R**
+ In **radiants** to degrees:

	+ Any multiple of $\pi/2$ is multiple of 90º
	+ Any multiple of $\pi/4$ is a multiple of 45º
	+ Any multiples of $\pi/3$ and $\pi/6$ are multiples of 60º and 30º respectively.

## Derived functions:
Those functions that can be derived from the basic sin and cos, with their respective graphs, are: 

$$
tan(x) = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
$$
+ **Dom(tan x) =** $\{x \not = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi, k \in Z\}$ → There is no function for cos x = 0

$$
cotg(x) = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
$$

$$\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos x}$$
$$cosec (x) = \frac{1}{sin(x)}$$

**CAREFUL:** sec(x) and cosec(x) are not the same as the following two functions: arcsin(x) and arccos(x). 
While sec(x) and cosec(x) are defined as 1 over the function. The arc…(x) functions are defined as the **inverse functions**, see [[20240615 - 202910 - Definition - Inverse function|Inverse function]]


Arcsin and Arcos functions are obtained by **reversing the relation of the sin and cosine** 
For sin: 
$$
\sin x = \frac{oposite}{hypotenus}
$$

arcsin is defined as: 
$$
\arcsin x = \frac{hypotenus}{oposite}
$$
Same for the arcos(x)

**Thee domain for both arc functions** is: [-1,1]

## Trigonometric relations:
All trigonometric functions are related in several ways, these relations are compiled in the following note:
