# The natural logarithm: 

The natural logarithm of x is defined as the logarithm with base e of x.

$$
\log_e x
$$
There are some really useful properties surrounding the natural logarithm. 

**Remarks:**
+ **Notation** for the natural logarithm can vary between: $\ln x$ , $\log x$ or $\log_e x$


**Properties:**
1. Any logarithm is related to the natural logarithm by a constant.
$$
\log_a x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln a}
$$
2. e to the power of the natural logarithm is whatever there is inside: 
$$
e^{\ln x}=x
$$
3. Sum and substraction turn into multiplication and division
$$
 \ln {a} - \ln {b} = \ln{a/b}
$$
$$
 \ln {a} + \ln {b} = \ln{a\times b}
$$
