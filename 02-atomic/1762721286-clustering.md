# clustering
> [!info] Intro: 
> A **cluster**  is just a grouping |collection of data points. The main question is, what defines that a point belongs or not to a cluster?
> The quick answer is "similar points belong to the same cluster and are disimilar to points in other clusters"
- Clustering is (as well as used for finding groups of similar data) used as a preprocessing step. 

>[!important] Properties:
> 1. **Intra-class similarity:** There will be a high intra class similarity if points within each cluster are similar to one another
> 2. **Inter-class similarity:** There will be a high inter class similarity if points from different clusters are really different to each other.

A good clustering method will focus on producing clusters with high itra-class similarity and low inter-class similarity
The major clustering approaches are:
- [[1762722095-partitionalclustering|partitional clustering]]
- [[1762722122-hierarchicalclustering|hierarchical clustering]]
- [[1762722177-densitybasedclustering|density-based clustering]]

Some of these approaches will need the user to specify the number of clusters, also it is important to analyze the data we want to cluster. So that if there are no clusters we know it. 

We also need to analyze how good are the created clusters, this step is called [[1762729222-clustervalidity|cluster validity]].
