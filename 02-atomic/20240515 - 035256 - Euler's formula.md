# Euler’s formula

## Applied to graphs:
> [!NOTE] Euler’s formula
> A **plane and connected grap**h G = (V,E) divides the plane into R regions or faces such that: 
> $$
> |V| - |E| + R = 2
> $$
> 
> **IF:** Plane and not necessarily connected, **THEN:**
> $$
> |V| - |E| + R = 1 + \text{ number of connected components of G }
> $$
