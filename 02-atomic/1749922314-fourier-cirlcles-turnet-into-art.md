# fourier cirlcles turnet into art
With some math and fourier series line pictures can be drawn, this means that if I can create a program that creates this cirlces and makes it all as an animation, just like in the manim video, then I can create some sort of "give a value to the circle" interactive gui so that anyone can just alter one of the circles and see how it all changes as a whole.
