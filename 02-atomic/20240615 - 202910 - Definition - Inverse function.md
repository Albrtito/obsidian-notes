# Inverse function: 
Given the definition of [[20240603 - 163014 - Definition - Function|Function]], the inverse function of f is such as if: 
$$
f: A\rightarrow B
$$
Then: 
$$
f^{-1}: B \rightarrow A
$$

**Remarks:**

> [!NOTE] Theorem:
> If f is continuous and bijective on an interval. then $f^{-1}$ is also continuous in the corresponding interval.  

## Differentiability of a function and it’s inverse
> [!NOTE] Theorem: 
> If f is a **bijective continuous function fefined on an interval and it is differentiable on $^{-1}(b)$ with $f’(f^{-1}(b)) \not = 0$**, then $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at b and: 
> $$
> (f^{-1})'(b)=\frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(b)\right)}
> $$
