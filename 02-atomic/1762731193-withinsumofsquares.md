# within-sum-of-squares
> [!info] Intro: 
> The within sum of squares is used in cluster analysis as the sum of the squared distances between each observation and its cluster centroid. 
> $$WSS = \sum^N_{n=1}\sum^K_{k=1}u_{n,k}\cdot||x_{n}-c_{k}||^2$$
> **where:**
> - The value $u_{n,k}$ representes membership of a point to a cluster (0 if the point does not belong to the current cluster)
> - The difference squared. The difference of the squared euclidean distance between an observation and the cluster center. (bars are for euclidean distance)
#incomplete The expression i believe is not right
