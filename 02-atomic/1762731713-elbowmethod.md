# elbow method
> [!info] Intro: 
> The elbow method is used for cluster validation, getting the number of optimal clusters. **It is a visual method**, so it requires someone to look at it.

It plots [[1762731193-withinsumofsquares|WSS]], the decrease in WSS will be much greater at the begining, then when an optimal number of clusters have been found WSS changes slower. 
So basically looking at the improvement of WSS with different number of clusters.

>[!bug] Problems:
> 1. Because is visual, determining the best number of clusters based on the elbow method can be pretty subjective.
