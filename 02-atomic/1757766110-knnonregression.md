# knn on regression
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> We can also use knn on a single dimensional variable, regression basically. In order to do this we’ll just compare by doing the mean of the k neighbors near each value for x. 

- IF we go towards a k to big we’ll end up with an straight line, with k small same as in knn, overfitting.
