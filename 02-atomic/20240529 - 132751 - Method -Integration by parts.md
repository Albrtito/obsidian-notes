Integration by parts is a method used to integrate expressions for which there is no possible substitution. 
The method realises a conversion in the following way: 

$$
\int u \cdot dv = u\cdot v - \int v\cdot du$$
**NOTE:**
+ En español usando la frase: 
  “**U**n **D**ía **V**í **U**na **V**aca **V**estida **D**e **U**niforme”

**Remarks:** 
+ If seeing an integral similar to: 
$$
\int x e^x dx 
$$
Its going to be integration by parts
