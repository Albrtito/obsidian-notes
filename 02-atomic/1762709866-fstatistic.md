# f-statistic
> [!info] Intro: 
> The f statistic checks if a regression model is better than the **mean only fit**. And if so, how much better. 
> **Big values are better**, however the analysis of the f-statistic is usually done hand by hand with the probability of itself. **If the probability of the F statistic is low is better**. (Because then the probability of a mean only fit being better than the current fit is low)
