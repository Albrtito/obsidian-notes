# Router
## Hight-level Architecture:
![[Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 10.09.35 AM.png|center|600]]

### Input ports: 
  Where physical-layer links terminate. 
  + The actual input ports **requests the forwarding tables information** to know where to send the packets. The request and computation is then performed in the **routing processor.**  This whole function is called [[1730648938 - Input port processing in routers|Input port processing]]
    
### Switching fabric: 
Connection of the input ports to the output ports.
+ There are several [[1730650392 - Types of switching fabrics|Types of switching fabrics]]

### Output ports 
Get packets from the switching fabric and transmit them to the outgoing link.
+ There is a queue based on the time to retransmit 
+ Output ports can **select and schedule packets**: FIFO, Round Robin, etc. See [[1730651054 - Router packet scheduling methods|Packet scheduling]]

### Routing processor (a CPU):
+ Performs the [[1730567097 - The network layer control plane|Control plane]] functions. 
+ Saves and computes the forwarding tables.
+ Executes routing protocols 
+ Recieves and communicates with remote controllers (in SDN approach). 
+ Performs network management funcitons.


> [!ATTENTION] Remark 
> See that input-output ports and switching fabrics implementations **must be done directly into the hardware in order to keep up whith the necessary speed**. 
> However the routing processor is implemented in software as the speed of its functions is not that important.

## Queuing: 
How and where does queuing occur in the routers? … See [[Net_Biblio_Kurose.pdf#page=347|Reference in Kurose’s book]]
