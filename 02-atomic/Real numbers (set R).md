# Intro: 
The set of real numbers is indicated by the letter R. This set is the union of the rational and irrational sets. R contains all numbers defined in [Natural numbers (set N)](set%20N)).md)[Integer numbers (set Z)](set%20Z)).md)[Rational and irrational numbers(set Q and I)](set%20Q%20and%20I)).md). 

+ Real numbers can be represented as points in the real line. 
+ When representing real numbers the whole line is filled up with them. (continuous space)

# Properties: 
## 1.  R is a completely ordered set
The set R increases. Given two real numbers either one is bigger than the other or they are equal.
## 2. ![Absolute value of x](Absolute%20value%20of%20x.md)
## 3. ![20240603 - 113531 - Definition - Intervals](20240603%20-%20113531%20-%20Definition%20-%20Intervals.md)
## 4. ![20240603 - 102925 - Definition - Neighbourhoods](20240603%20-%20102925%20-%20Definition%20-%20Neighbourhoods.md)
