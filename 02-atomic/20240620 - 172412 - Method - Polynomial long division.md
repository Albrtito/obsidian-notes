# Polynomial long division: 
It is just like division but with polynomials. 
In order to refresh how to do it: [Khan Academy: Long division for polynomials](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-polynomials/alg-long-division-of-polynomials/v/dividing-polynomials-1)

This method letâ€™s us obtain the following for two polynomials: 
$$
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
$$
Where: 
$\deg(P(x)) < \deg(Q(x))$ 

We can then represent the fraction of polynomials as: 
$$
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = S(x) + \frac{R(x)}{Q(x)}
$$
Where: 
+ $S(x)$ is the solution to the long division of P and Q.
+ R(x) is the remainder of that division
