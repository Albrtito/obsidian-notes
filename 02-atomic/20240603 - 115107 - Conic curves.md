# Conic curves: 
Using the definition of distance between two points P = (x1,y1) and Q=(x2,y2):
$$
dist(P,Q) = \sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}
$$
We define the curves known as **conics:**

1. [[20240603 - 115254 - Definition - Parabola|Parabola]]
2. [[20240603 - 115628 - Definition -  Circumference|Circumference]]
3. [[20240603 - 162222 - Definition - Ellipse|Ellipse]]
4. [[20240603 - 115952 - Definition - Hyperbola|Hyperbola]]

**Remarks:**

+ These curves are the ones obtained when performing cuts of a cone with a plane. 
+ Theoretically: The point and the [[20240603 - 114227 - Definition - Straight line|Definition - Straight line]] are also conics.
