# tokyonight theme derivation
> [!info] Intro: 
> Creating a theme from scratch? Why? It wont have the support for as many things as themes such as tokyonight have. The colorschemes for this themes can be slightly modified however i want while still maintaining all the work and effort put into them. 

My idea is to use tokyonight-night (maybe moon for lighter or even maybe light mode) as a template and just make changes from that point onwards. 
This will mean getting all the tokyonight colors from the git repo (maybe the nvim one and use lua) and then creating the needed files (ports) for:
- [ ] ghostty
- [ ] obsidian
- [ ] nvim
	- Mostly available
- [ ] ls and others (LS_COLORS)
	- Maybe available somehow, if else custom
- [ ] sketchybar
	-  Will need a custom theme
The best thing would be to look into how it is ported to ghostty. But if not just making a program that alters the configuration files for each of this programs.
