# Proper colorings
Discrete mathematics has a whole branch of people coloring graphs in different ways. Given some rules, is it possible to color de graph?

In this whole field of investigation a term for coloring a graph in a distinctive way has been created: **Proper colorings**. Then, coloring a graph in the proper way **means that no two adjacent vertices will have the same colour.** This could seem arbitrary at first, however it has applications such as the widely spread sudoku game. It can also be applied to create group schedules or rotations.

## Definitions: 

For graph colorings there are two main theorems, the chromatic polynomial and the contraction-deletion theorem.
