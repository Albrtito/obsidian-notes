# Intro: 
**Rational numbers** compose an infinite set of fractions created from integer numbers. The set is defined as: 
$$
\mathbb{Q} = \{a/b, with a,b \in Z, b \not = 0\}
$$
+ The set Q is closed under all four basic operators (sum, difference, product and ratio)
+ Given two rational numbers p and q. There exist an infinite number of rational numbers between them. 
+ A nice property of rational numbers is that it can be proven that there is the same infinite number of rational numbers than natural integer numbers. 

**Irrational numbers** are those that cannot be computed as a fraction of two integers and have decimal (non periodic) values. These numbers are represented as the set I
