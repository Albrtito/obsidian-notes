# SQL DML

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Data Manipulation Language is the one in charge of changing the **contents of the objects defined previously in the [[1743006292 - SQL DDL|SQL DDL]]**. It can be used in three ways:
> 1. Directly into the SQL console
> 2. Embedded into other programming languages
> 3. Using modules
> 
> It contains **three actualization operations:**
> + Tuple insertion
> + Tuple deletion
> + Tuple modification
> And **one retrieval operator:**
> + Queries → Selection of tuples
> 

## Selection (SELECT):
The select operator **returns tuples** based on some conditions: 
```SQL
[WITH
	<symbol> AS <subquery>
	[, <symbol> AS <subquery> ...]]
]

SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] <selection_list>
	FROM <source_clause>
	[WHERE <condition>]
	[GROUP BY <criterion> [HAVING <condition>]]
	[{UNION|UNION ALL|MINUS|INTERSECT} <query>]
	[ORDER BY <criterion> [ASC|DESC]]
;
```

**Where:**
```SQL
<selection_list> := {*|attributes|pseudo-columns| constant values | functions}
```
+ * → **wildcard** value meaning all the values of a table 
+ attributes → of the workspace relation scheme (columns of the table created in the from statement)
+ See [[#The `<source_clause>`]] for description.
+ See [[#The WHERE]] for more information on this clause.

**Remarks:**
+ See that the `<symbol> AS <subquery>` is the SQL representation of the **renaming operator.** Because SELECT queries can take a ton of space it is usefull to give each subquery a symbol to make it all more readable and avoid errors. 
+ See that every other operator in the query also has it’s relation to Relational Algebra [[1739196838 - DB Relational dynamics|DB Relational dynamics]]
### The FROM `<source_clause>`:
The **workspace** is the **temporal table defined in the FROM clause** → `<source_clause>`. Defined using one of the following operators:
+ **Basic Combination:** Cartesian product:
```SQL
... FROM <table_1> CROSS JOINT <table_2> ... := FROM people, clients ...
```

+ **General JOIN:** All columns in both tables:
	+ Without spacification: Join all columns named identically
	+ With ON clause: Only the ones matching expression
```SQL
... FROM <table_1> [INNER] JOIN <table_2> [on (<col_a>{=|!=|< | >|} <col_b> [AND ...])]
```

+ **Natural JOIN:** Does not provide twice the columns in the joining key
	+ Every column named identically in both tables without USING
	+ With USING: Only the specified columns
```SQL
... FROM <table_1> [NATURAL [INNER]] JOIN <table_2> [USING (<columns>)]...
```

+ **Lossless combination:** Outer JOIN
	+ ![[1743010495 - SQL DMLj.png]]
```
... FROM <table_1> {LEFT|RIGHT|FULL} [OUTER] JOIN <table_2> [USING <columns> | ON <col_a>{=|!=| < | >} <col_b> [AND ...]]
```

### The WHERE: 
The WHERE statement is used to impose conditions and can be:
+ A **comparison:** Where the operands can be values, expressions or a subquery
+ **Null value test**: `<expression> IS [NOT] NULL`
+ **alike test:** `<char_exp> [NOT] LIKE <pattern>`
+ **logical expression:** {NOT,AND,OR}
+ **inclusion test:** `<expression> [NOT] BETWEEN <exp> AND <exp>`
+ **inclusion test (subquery):** `<expression> [NOT] IN {<expression_list> | subquery}
+ **existence test:** `EXISTS subquery` 

However **using subqueries in where cuold be inefficient**. 

### Running order: 
The whole SELECT operator is really big and therfore to detect errors (among other things) knowing the running order of it is usefull. 
1. WITH
2. FROM 
3. WHERE 
4. GROUP BY
5. UNION | UNION ALL | MINUS | INTERSECT
6. ORDER BY
7. SELECT
This just tells us that before doing the actual select all other subqueries are performed.
