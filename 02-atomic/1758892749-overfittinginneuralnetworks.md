# overfitting in neural networks
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> How can we prevent overfittin in neural networks? What drives the overfitting in neural networks?

#duda
Based on the question of the ms course and the solution by claude.


- reducing the number of epochs (iterations of the training set)
- reducing the number of neurons or layers in the network
- using regularization (penalizing high weights)
- reducing the learning rate: Would make sense based on the fact that smaller learning rate prevents hard
