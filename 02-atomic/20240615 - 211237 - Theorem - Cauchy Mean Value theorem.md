# Cauchy Mean Value theorem: 

> [!NOTE] Theorem: Cauchy Mean Value 
> Given two functions f and g continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), **then exists some c in (a,b) such that**
> $$
> [f(b) - f(a) ]g'(c) = [g(b) - g(a)]f'(a)
> $$
> For g(b) - g(a) ≠ 0 and g’(c) ≠ 0 then: 
> $$
> \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}
> $$
> 


## Mean value theorem: 
Is the same as applying the general theorem but with g(x) = x

> [!NOTE] Theorem: Mean value 
> If f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there is some c such: 
> $$
> c \in (a,b)
> $$
> $$
> \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)
> $$
> 

Graphically this means that there exist a point c for which it’s tangent line is parallel to the line created when using the vector ab as direction.
