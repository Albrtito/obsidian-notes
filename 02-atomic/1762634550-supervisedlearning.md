# supervised learning
> [!info] Intro: 
> Suppervised learning is the area of machine learning that takes all models using some already existing data to fit a function over it.
> Namely, given some data already classified, obtain a function that takes input in the form of the given data and outputs a classs for it. 
> The objective is to generalise as in all machine learning. So that once the funciton|model is obtained we can just give it some new data and it'll spit out the class or position or whatever it belongs to.
