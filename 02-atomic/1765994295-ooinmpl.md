# oo in mpl
> [!info] Intro: 
> OO programming in mpl revolves around the plots and the objects that compose them. These plots are defined by: 
> - The figure object 
> - The axis object

The figure object defines the **top level container for all plot elements**
The axis define tick rates, legends, it is the class where the points are drawn. 

>[!attention] Remarks:
> - Because these are the only two objects defining the whole image, it would be nice that new functions that plot (personal functions) just return these two objects. This way the function is not plotting itself but returning the plot.
