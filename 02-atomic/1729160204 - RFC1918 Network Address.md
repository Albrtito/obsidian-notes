# RFC1918 Network Address

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> IP addresses within the RFC1918 are those **assigned to a local private network**. This is done because there is no need of unique IP addresse between different private networks.

+ Computers assigned an RFC1918 number are considered as **private host** as they need to connect to the internet through a router or such. 
+ This addressses where created because there are not enough IPv4 addresses for all hosts of the internet.
