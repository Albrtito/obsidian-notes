# formal language
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> A formal language $L$ is an (infinite) set of finite lenght strings

- All **symbols** are inside the alphabet $$\sum$$
- All **strings** will be made out of symbols of the alphabet. 
	- String = word = sentence
	- Don’ really care about separators between words as that can be seen as a bigger word
- A language may include the empty string as $\lambda$

> [!example] notation
> - $\sum ^*$ : The dictionary|language composed by all possible words created from the alphabet $\sum$. **The empty string is included**
