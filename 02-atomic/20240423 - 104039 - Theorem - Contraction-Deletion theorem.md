> [!NOTE] Theorem: Contraction-deletion 
> Given G = (V,E) as a simple graph and e = {x,y} $\in E$ with x,y $\in$ V.  
> **Then:** We can obtain the chromatic polynomial in the following way. 
> $$
> P_G(q)=P_{G-e}(q) + P_{G/e}(q)
> $$
> + G-e: Graph when the edge e is deleted
> + G/e: Graph when the edge e is contracted(join the vertices that the edge is conecting)
