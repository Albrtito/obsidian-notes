The problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg is what initialises the creation of eulerian trails. This problem states the following: 

The old city of Königsberg had the following structure that could be represented with a graph:

When Euler walked the city he asked himself: 
**Is there a way to start walking at some point of the city and end up in the same point after crossing every bridge EXACTLY ONCE?**

The circuits of this type are called eulerian circuits. From this problem we get the eulerian graphs, tours and trails.Because of the properties of those (see backlinks) we know that there is **no solution to this problem**, no way of completing the proposed circuit.
