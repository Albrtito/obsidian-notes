# Transport network layer

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> The transport layer occupies itself of **sending(encoding)the messages generated by the application layer through the network.** 
> 
> We’ll see in this note that there are challenges to that transport like transfering the data reliablely, controlling the rate of packages or solving congestion problems. We’ll also see the different protocols there are to send packets and how they work.

## Transport layer services and actions:
Services and protocols provide **logical communication between systems,** they divide the host between: 

+ **Sender:** The one braking appart the message into packets and sending it. It occupies itself of:
  + **Creating segment:** message + header + checksum
  + **Pass segment to IP/Network:** To the next layer

+ **Reciever:** The one recieving packets and sending them to the app layer
  + **Recieves segment + checks header:** check everything is ok
  + **Extract message:** For application
  + **Pass message to the app socket by DEMULTIPLEXING:** See demultiplexing in the next part


> [!attention] Differences between transport and network: 
> Transport layer is going to do the communication between **processes** while the network layer is doing the **communication betweeen hosts**. 

> f.e: If we had letters being send between houses, the transport layer is the langage and directions in the letter itself while the network layer is the postmain that decides wich route to take. 

### Transport protocols: 
There are two main transport protocols: 
+ [[1727428429 - Definition - UDP|UDP]]
+ [[1727428451 - Definition - TCP|TCP]]
We’ll see in the next part that UDP is a **connectionless protocol** and TCP is a **connection-oriented protocol**.

Another important feature in transport protocols is whether they can transmit data reliabely or not, see [[1727176650 - Principles of reliable data transfer|Principles of reliable data transfer]] for methods and a whole explanation of this.
## Multiplexing and demultiplexing:

> [!NOTE] Multiplexing: 
> The act of handling data of **multiple sockets**, putting a header and sending it over the network.
> Packets are comming from multiple sockets, so we put a header to each of one saying the socket it comes from,where it goes to, and send them without a proper order into the network.
+ Each datagram will have a mix of the four variables: **Destination IP + Port** and **Source IP + Port**. 
  Based on the type of multiplexing  and demultiplexing performed an n-tuple of these four values will be sent.


> [!NOTE] Demultiplexing: 
> The opposite of multiplexing, using the header to know into which socket must the packet be delivered. 

### Connectionless demultiplexing:
Used with **UDP**
+ Referenced by only destination and source ports? #duda: more info about this.
+ Is this a broadcast to all ports connected to that network?
+ Then we wont need the IP
+ There is no need for a handshake between sender and reciever
### Connection-oriented demultiplexing:
Used with **TCP**
+ Referenced by the 4-tuple of:
  **Source IP, port
  Destinatino IP, port**

+ Sockets are identified by all four properties. This means that two clients can connect to the same port because their respective source ip addresses are different.
