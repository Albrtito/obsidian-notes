> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The tower is still constructed by adding pieces on top of it. However, when wanting to get a piece, instead of getting the piece from the top of the tower we go and try to get it from the bottom. (like playing the tower game)
>- We insert enqueue → New at the end
>- We remove dequeue → Get the first element

>The normal queue we all know and love. The logical one
