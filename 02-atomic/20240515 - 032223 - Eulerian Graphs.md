# Eulerian graphs: 
One day was Euler walking and why not he thought of the problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg.

## Euler tours and trails:

> [!NOTE] Definition: Euler tour
> An **Euler tour** is a circuit (closed by definition) that **contains every edge of the graph**. 
> + **IF:** A graph contains an Euler tour **Then:** It is an eulerian graph


> [!NOTE] Euler trail
> The difference with a tour is that the trail can be open, it can start at one point and end in another one.
> A connected graph contains an Euler trail **if and only if:**
> + It contains exactly two vertices of odd degree 



> [!NOTE] Definition: Eulerian graphs
> A connected graph is Eulerian **if and only if** 
> + The degree of all its vertices is even.

## Algorithm for obtaining eulerian tours: 
Once we know that a graph is eulerian we can obtain an eulerian tour on it, in order to do so we follow [[20240515 - 033826 - Algorithm - Fleury's algorithm|Fleury's algorithm]].
