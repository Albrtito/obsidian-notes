> - https://omarchy.org
> An arch distro that comes with a ton of things preinstalled and ready to work. This could be nice to have something up and running in desktop computers.

I just question: 
- How big is it 
- Is it basic keybinds or custom ones?

But as inspiration: 
- There is some interesting things in the presntation video. 
- Maybe use it as inspiration for the future distros
