# regression
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Regression is a method for fitting a function through some data points (observations). For this we’ll use some cost function and try to minimize it.

- During the ms course we’ll almost allways use the [[1758649312-sumofsquarederrorfunction|SSE]] function as cost function

> [!example] Dictionary:
> - **prediction | hypothesis** → The prediction of a model, also called hypothesis is given based on some input x and follows a function usually denoted by $h_{\Theta}(x)$ or $f_{\Theta}(x)$. Then:
>   $$ \hat y = h_{\Theta}(x) | f_{\Theta}(x)$$
> - **Coefficients** → In the hypothesis function we’ll use some coefficients, denoted by $\hat \Theta_i$ for each $x_i$. 
>   The cap is there as we are also **estimating coefficients**. Altough most times the hat is not shown

## modeling regression
A regression model would generalize to:
$$\hat y = \theta_0 + \theta1*x_1 + ... + \theta_D*x_D$$
where:
- Each x is a feature
- Each theta is a coefficient
- $\theta_0$ Is the initial starting point (ordenada en el origen)

This can eb rewriteen as: $\hat y = \theta^TX$ where now we have $\theta$ as a vector (transposed and X as a matrix):
$$Vector \space \theta=\left[\begin{array}{c}\theta_0 \\ \theta_1 \\ \cdots \\ \theta_D\end{array}\right] \quad Matrix\space x=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & \cdots \\ x_1^{(1)} & x_1^{(2)} & \cdots \\ \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ x_D^{(1)} & x_D^{(2)} & \cdots\end{array}\right] $$
where:
- In the matrix each row represents a variable and each column an observation. The parenthesis number with x means the observation number. 

Using the **MSE** error function we could now generalize to:
$$
J(w) = \frac{1}{n} \sum^N_{n=1}((\theta_nx_n^{(i)}) - y_n^{(i)})^2
$$
where:
- **i** → The observation

And then try to minimize that cost function, **the whole objective of this all**, to **obtain the coefficients for the min**:
$$
min_{\theta_0,...\theta_D} \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(h_\theta(x)-y^{(i)})^2
$$

> If we this whole structure in a 2d space with only one variable and the prediction in the other axis we’ll have to minimize the cost given by: 
> $$Cost = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_1(\theta_1*x_1^{(i)}-y^{(i)})^2$$
> And if we try some values for the theta we’ll see that the costs based on values (secondary cost plot) will be something parabolic. So a best value and then some worsening to the sides. 
> 
> When working with data that needs an “ordenada en el origen”, justa add the $\theta_0$.


> [!attention] Remark:
> So **the objective here is to find the values for thetas so that we get the min value for the cost function.**
> But we cannot just “try some values randomply”. So we’ll use gradient descent
