> [!NOTE] Proposition 23: Ordered subsets
> Instead of just substracting one (like in permutations) and using the factorial to compute it, now there are **an specific number of spots to arrange the elements**. 
> **Then** we need to subtract one until there are no more spots left
>
+ Formula: Compute the permutation and delete the unwanted spots
$$
n!\over (n-r)!
$$
	**r: The number of spots to arrange** 
	Specify where to stop


+ **Allowing repetitions**: If two elements can repeat, then no need of subtracting one each time, just multiply by the number of elements in the set the number of times equal to the spots u have. This means. 
$$
n^r
