# proxy
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> A proxy or proxy server stands between a host and the internet. Takes the hosts messages and forwards them (with changes if necessary).

It's a man in the middle. So it can be a good one, balancing the load of several webservers by redirecting to one or the other, or a bad one, catching things (listening) or even changing packets on the fly.
