# suport vector machine
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> A support vector machine works on finding the threshold hyperplane that divides two classes (so **binary classification**) performing linear separation.
> 
> **Remember:** To get the best linear separation possible we are looking for the **maximized margin** on the threshold.

- Assume that the hyperplane exists
- Assume that the classes are **linearly separable**, this means that there is no misclassification between them

> [!example] Dictionary:
> - $||a||$ → The normalized vector a. Using the **Euclidean normalization** (for ms course and usually)
> - **margin** → Usint $\rho$ to reference it
> - **soft margin** → A soft margin is one that **allows misclassification**. 
> - **soft classifier** → A classifier that allows misclassification

To maximize the margin we need to look into where each of the suporting vectors is. We’ll follow then:

$$
\begin{align}
w^Tx_a + b - 1 = w*Tx_b + b + 1\\
(q^tx_a+b)-(w^tx_b+b)=2\\
w^t(x_a-x_b)=2\\
||x_a-x_b|| = \frac{2}{||w||}
\end{align}
$$
where:
- a and b are the identifiers for each vector

What this tells us is that the difference between those two vectors (the margin) is equal to $2\over ||w||$. Ans so the smaller that w gets, the bigger that difference will be. 
If we can find a min(w) then we should get the best w possible. 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{we want: }\space min(\frac{1}{2}||w||^2)\\
\text{subject to: }\space y_i(w^tx_i + b)\geq 1
\end{align}
$$

## allowing misclassification
There are some non-separable patters that wont be classifiable with a hard SVM classifier.
This is done using some slack variables $\zeta_i$.
$$
y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1 - \zeta_i
$$
We only need this slack variables for points that are actually misclasified. 
$$
\zeta_i = max(0,1-y_i(w^Tx_i+b))
$$
This way the slack variable is 0 if no slack is needed but then, if the distance to the threshold is smaller than 1 the 1-(distance) is bigger than 0 and that is taken. 

Now with this definition we can inlcude the slack into the optimization problem (trying to find min(w)). To do this we can **allow some total sum of slack**. 
$$
\sum_1^l \zeta_i
$$
And then add it into the minimization with some penalty C
$$
\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C \sum_1^l \zeta_i
$$
## non-linear patterns,kernel trick
For patterns that initially look like they cannot be saparated by one line we can try to map them into an extra dimension, makig it so that in this new dimensions we can actually use the model. 

This transformation of the data is called **a kernel of the data** and we name it as $\phi(x_i), \phi(y_i)$. 
- A type of this (looking at the class slides) would be polynomial. Just creating an new variable (to the powers of the polynomials)
- There is some appendix with kernel functions in the slides

Kernel lets us work in this higher space **without actually working in the high space**. This is called **the kernel trick**
