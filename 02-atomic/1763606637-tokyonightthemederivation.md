# tokyonight theme derivation
> [!info] Intro: 
> Creating a theme from scratch? Why? It wont have the support for as many things as themes such as tokyonight have. The colorschemes for this themes can be slightly modified however i want while still maintaining all the work and effort put into them. 

My idea is to use tokyonight-night (maybe moon for lighter or even maybe light mode)
