****# Antisymmetry: 
**Remark:** Itâ€™s not the same if some relation is not symmetric than for it to be antisymmetric. 

> [!NOTE] Definition 131
> A relation is antisymmetric if for any two elements x and y  in V: 
> **IF**: 
> + x related to y AND y related to x
> **THEN**: 
>+ This can only mean that x is equal to y

for example: 
	The relation: $xRy \Leftrightarrow x \leq y$
	Take x y $\in$ N
	If xRy and yRx then x is lower or equal to y and y is lower or equal to x.This means that The only possibility is that x is equal to y .
