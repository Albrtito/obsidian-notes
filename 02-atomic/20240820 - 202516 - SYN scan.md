# SYN scan
1. Send a SYN (synchronization) packet to every port. 
2. Wait for the SYN (synchronizatoin) response. This means the port is **open**
	1. Send a RST (reset) packet making it so the server assumes that there has been a communications error. 
3. If the server sends an RST(reset) packet from a port, the port is closed. If the RST comes with an ACK it is also closed.

## Analysis: 
When looking at an scan of this type with nmap, the packets are marked in the outputs with flags. 
+ S = SYN
+ A = ACK
+ R = RST 
These flags can be joined together, for example, (RA) would be RST and ACK packets received.
