# diy external screens
> [!info] Intro: 
> Some references on external screen made diy. Basically lcd + driver board + \[battery\] inside some case.

- [**DIY Perks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2aY6cvk-WI&t=43s): An screen on top of the computer, nice idea but super rough and bulky.
- [nambaron DIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yCa0NtO3Ng): More polished, maybe a good style to go with a macbook air
- [DIY Perks 2:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrqdHVeBkp4) Going for a second and improved version but only outside, however the new board he uses here is slimmer, fewer ports but slimmer.
