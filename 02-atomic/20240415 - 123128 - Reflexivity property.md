> [!NOTE] Property 
> A relation R is reflexive if every element in the domain is related to itself such as: 
> $$
> \forall v\in V \Rightarrow vRv
> $$

**Remarks:** 
+ When representing this on a graph, it means that for every element thereâ€™ll be a loop
+ **Difference with symmetry:** Symmetry means that the relation between **two elements** goes from one to the other and reverse. Reflexivity only matters for one single element. (like a mirror?)
