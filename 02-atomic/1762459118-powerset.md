# Power set
> [!info] Intro:
> Definition of the power set as the set **contains all possible subsets of set A**. Meaningly, all possible groupings (in no particular order) of items in set A.

**Proof:** Sum all the possible subsets for each of the possible number of elements in the subset. Based on the [[20240515 - 013001 - Theorem - Newton's binomial theorem|Newton's binomial theorem]] when x = 1 and y = 1.

>[!important] Properties:
> 1. **Cardinality of the power set:** The cardinality of the power set of A is computed using the power of 2 to the cardinality of A.  $$|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}$$ To understand why is this so lets think about how the subsets can be created. 
>    1. Start with an empty subset, create
