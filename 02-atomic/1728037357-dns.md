# DNS

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> DNS or Domain Name System refers to the distributed application performing the resolution of domains to ip addresses and vice versa.
> It transforms the name of a page in the internet(humanly readable text)  into the brute ip addres (an string of numbers that wont make any sense to humans).

>   \text{myWebPage.com} \rightarrow 97.345.321.342
>   $$

- A gigantinc distributed database because not all ip-domain pairs can be kept in one place only. 
+ **application-layer protocol**
+ ==Uses the [[1727428429 - Definition - UDP|UDP]] protocol for speed.== 
## How it works: 
The DNS database follows a decentralized structure in order to **prevent an internet crisis if volume increases** and prevent having a **single point of failure**. 

When someone requests a page to the DNS service, their computer will search for it recursively in different servers, starting with the local one. Once the query is not fount in a server it goes one level up and asks for it to the next (bigger) server. 

There are two ways to query a server:

+ **Iterated query:** Each server asked returns the path to the next server that needs to be asked
+ **Recursive query:** Each server ask the next server needed and returns the answer they give.
