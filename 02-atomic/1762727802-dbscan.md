# DBSCAN
> [!info] Intro: 
> DBSCAN or Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise. Is a Density-Based clustering method

>[!example] Dictionary:
> - **Eps $\varepsilon$->** Maximum radius of the neighbourhood
> - **MinPts->** Min number of points in the Eps-neighbourhood of a point
> - **Density->** Number of points within a specified radius (Eps)
> DBSCAN differentiates three types of points:
> - **Core point->** Point in the interior of a cluster
> - **Border point->** Has fewer than MinPts within Eps but is in the neighbourhood of a core point
> - **Noise point->** Is any point that is not a core point or a border point


>[!important] Properties:
> 1. **High density:** Some area is high density if the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of an object contains at least MinPts of objects


> In the following example, for two objects p and q.

## Pros and cons:
**Pros:**
- Resistant to noise
- Differently shaped clusters
**Cons:**
- Does not work well with varying densities
- Does not work well with high dimensional data
