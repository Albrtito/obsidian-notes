# changing to lazyvim
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Forgetting about constant chagnes in my nvim config for every single think would be nice, also having a minimal config is nice. 

- looking at latest [omerx video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evCmP4hH7ZU) it is not making nvim slower (or at least i need to check how fast my config is nowadays working).
- It has way to many things. As omer says, exploring lazyvim is a thing. So I'll get lost on it more than on my current config
- On the other side I'll also be aprovechando a lot of features I have not been able ot use for the last years
- It would be **essential to read a lot of the documentation and how the distribution is organised bfore changing. And changing during i time i can do so**
- It can be just loaded anywhere anytime with the curl to the repo.
