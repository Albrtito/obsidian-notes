# creating temporary tags
> [!info] Intro: 
> When creating new tags the problem is whether this tag will be usefull or not in the future. Then, if tags can first be created as "temporal" this makes it easier to go through all tmp tags once every month (or something like that) and check if the new tags are really useful. 

This new temporal tags are subtags of the #temp tag. So for the tag example. The temporal tag `#temp/example` is first created. Then given some time just look at how many new notes have been created with the tag `#temp/example` and just turn it into an actual `#example` tag.

>[!attention] Remarks:
> - Another idea could be to just drop the #temp tag. And create tags as `#/<tagname>` obsidian will let this happen and just not give the parent tag a name.
