## Separation of variables: 

The separation of variables method(also known as the fourier method) is used to **rewrite an equation so that each of two variables occurs on a different side of the equation**

Based on what learned in the **Differential calculus course in UC3M:** 

This method separes the variables of a function such as: 
$$
u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)
$$
