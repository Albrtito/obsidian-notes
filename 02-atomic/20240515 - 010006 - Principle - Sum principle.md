**Remarks:**
+ See that it does not require for the sets to be disjoint
**Usefulness** 
+ create unique pairs between sets. 
+ Break down procedures into smaller ones: If a procedure can be broken down into tasks that are consecutive. Then the ways of doing the procedure are computed by multiplying the multiplicities of the tasks.
