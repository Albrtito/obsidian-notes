# gray code
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Gray code | reflected binary code | reflected binary is a way of encoding digits in binary so that **two digits only differ from one bit**. 

To generate this code for some n number of digits we'll need m bits such as $2^m -1 \geq n$. Then the process is basically creating a table with alternative values for 0s and 1s every half,quarter,eight... of m until we get changes every digit. (see picture)

Used in areas where the change of state between one integer and the next one cannot be done in several states.
