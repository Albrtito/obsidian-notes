# Fundamental theorem of Calculus: 

The formal definition an theorem is useful, but before u go and look at it here are the main points:

**Given**: 
+ f continuous on \[a,b]
=> $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt$ 
=> $Fâ€™(x) = f(x)$ $\forall x \in [a,b]$

This means: 
+ The derivative of an integral is the function inside the integral. 

Now formally: 

> [!NOTE] Theorem: Fundamental theorem of calculus
> If f is continuous on [a,b] then the function: 
> $$
> F(x) =  \int_a^x f(t)dt
> $$
> is differentiable on \[a,b] and: 
> $$
> \begin{align}
> F'(X) = f(x) && \forall x \in [a,b]
> \end{align}
> $$
> At x = a and x = b we have side derivatives. 

**Remarks:**
As a Consequence of this theorem we obtain [[20240620 - 200345 - Method - Barrow's rule|Barrow's rule]] as a way of solving Definite integrals:
