# Power set
> [!info] Intro:
> Definition of the power set as the set **contains all possible subsets of set A**. Meaningly, all possible groupings (in no particular order) of items in set A.

**Proof:** Sum all the possible subsets for each of the possible number of elements in the subset. Based on the [[20240515 - 013001 - Theorem - Newton's binomial theorem|Newton's binomial theorem]] when x = 1 and y = 1.

>[!important] Properties:
> 1. **Cardinality of the power set:** The cardinality of the power set of A is computed using the power of 2 to the cardinality of A.  $$|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}$$ To understand why is this so lets think about how the subsets can be created we just need to see that for each element in the set there are exactly two choices, either it is or it is not in the subset. Then if we multipy the number of choices 2*2... we get the actual power set cardinality as two to the power of the cardinality of Aj
