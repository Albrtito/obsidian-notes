# Real variable functions: 

## Basic concepts:
Before anything else: Basic concepts and definitions of single-variable Calculus.

Real functions are defined over a domain, this domain can belong to several [[Sets of numbers]]. Each of these sets has important properties and principles.

For any of these subsets we can define [[20240603 - 112803 - Definition - Inequalities|Definition - Inequalities]] and the [[Absolute value of x]]. 
Finally, using the relation provided by inequalities [[20240603 - 113531 - Definition - Intervals|Intervals]] are defined over the set R.

## Elementary curves: 
Elementary curves are defined by basic/wellknown functions. The properties of these functions come usually in handy to solve exercises and understand more complex definitions.

The set of elementary curves that will be used during the UC3M calculus I course is: 
+ [[20240603 - 114227 - Definition - Straight line|Definition - Straight line]]
+ [[20240603 - 115107 - Conic curves|Conic curves]]

## What is a function? Definitions:

Partiendo de la definición de función dada aquí:
+ [[20240603 - 163014 - Definition - Function|Function]]

Real variable functions are those such as: 
$$
f: A \rightarrow B
$$
$$
A\in \mathbb{R}, B \in \mathbb{R}
$$
During the UC3M CalcI course we’ll be looking only at uni-variable calculus. This means only two dimensional functions. 
These functions can be drawn in graph obtaining the Cartesian coordinate: 
$$
(x,f(x))
$$
Some of the basic functions we’ll study and use are collected here: 
+ [[20240603 - 165215 - Elementary functions|Basic functions]]

We’ll be working with compositions and variations of these functions.
