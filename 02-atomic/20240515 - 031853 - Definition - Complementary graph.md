# Complementary graph: 

> [!NOTE] Definition:
> The complementary graph of G = (V,E) noted as $\overline G$ contains all vertices in V and every edge that is not contained in E. 
> $$
> \overline G = (V, \overline E)
> $$

f.e:
	For G = (V,E) with V = {1,2,3,4} and E ={(1,2),(3,4)}
	$\overline G$ = (V, $\overline{E}$) with V = {1,2,3,4} and $\overline{E}$ = {(3,1),(1,4),(4,2),(2,3)}
