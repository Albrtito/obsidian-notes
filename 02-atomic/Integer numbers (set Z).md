# Intro
The integer number set is an infinite set of integers denoted by the letter Z. As a quick recap: 
+ Integers can be positive or negative
+ The integer set contains  the natural numbers but also has all values of natural numbers with a negative sign and the value of zero
+ Z is closed under the operations of sum, difference and product. 
+ Z is open under the ration operator as it could output a rational number
