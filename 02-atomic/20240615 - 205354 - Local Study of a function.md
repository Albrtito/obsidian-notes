# Local study of a function:
Studying a function and it’s properties is usually divided into different areas. 

+ Study of the domain, symmetries and simple operations with the function.

+  Study of the [[20240616 - 155905 - Extrema|Extrema]], all the weird and interesting points that we can find, places where the function is not easily readable. 
   From this study we obtain: 
   + [[20240615 - 205544 - Definition - Local maximum and minimum points of a function|Local maximum and minimum points of a function]]
   + **Increasing and decreasing intervals**
   + **Location of asymptotes**

+  Study of the convexity of the function and it’s **inflection points**. 
   See: [[20240616 - 162016 - Convexity of a function|Convexity of a function]]
   From this study we obtain: 
   + **Intervals of convexity of the function** 
   + **Inflection points**
     
 +  Study of the [[20240616 - 162755 - Definition - Asymptotes|Asymptotes]] of the function. 
    From this study we obtain: 
    + **Position of the horizontal asymptotes**
    + **Position of the vertical asymptotes**
    + **Position of the oblique asymptotes**

## Construction of graphs: 
The study of a function implies that we may have to draw it’s graph. In this cases we must study all areas and use the information to draw an aproximation of the graph.
