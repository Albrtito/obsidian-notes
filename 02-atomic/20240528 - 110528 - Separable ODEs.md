# Separable ODEs
Separable ODEs are those ODEs such as de DE is a [[20240528 - 104744 - Definition - Separable Equations|Separable Equations]]

> [!NOTE] Definition:
> Separable ODE's are of the form: 
>$$
M(x)dx + N(y) dy = 0
>$$
>+ M(x) is a function in x: Only x as the unknown
>+ N(y) is a function in y: Only y as the unknown

f.e: 
	$$
	\frac{dy}{dx} = x(y-1)
	$$
	We can separe it: 
	$$
	\frac{dy}{y-1} = xdx
	$$
	In the general form: 
	$$
	-xdx + (\frac{1}{y-1})dy = 0
	$$
	We can see we have: 
	$M(x)  = -x$
	$N(y) = 1/y-1$
	
## Solving separable ODEs:

Once the separable ODE is separated we can solve with simple integration. 

$$
M(x) dx = -N(y)dy
$$
$$
\int M(x) dx = \int -N(y) dy
$$
$$
H_1(x) = H_2(y)
$$
**Remark:**
+ #duda : Pq podemos integrar en y y en x y sigue siendo equivalente. AÃºn siendo las integraciones en diferentes variables
+ Where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the antiderivatives of M and N. 

+ While integrating, both solutions will have their own constants. As all constants can be joined we obtain a general form: 
$$
H_1(x) + H_2(y) = C
$$
+ The signs do not really matter as both are functions that could potentially change them. 

The implicit solution is obtained when solving for y. 

f.e: Using the initial example: 
	$$
	\frac{dy}{y-1} = xdx
	$$
	$$
	\int \frac{dy}{y-1} = \int xdx 
	$$
	$$
	ln|y-1| + C_2 = \frac{x^2}{2} + C_1
		$$    Constants are unified into C3: 
	$$
	ln|y-1|  = \frac{x^2}{2} + C_3
	$$
	Simplifying for y and taking into account the absolute value:
	$$
	y(t) = 1 + Ce^{x^2 /2}
	$$
