Polynomial functions are those of the form: 
$$
f(x) = a_0 + a_1x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_nx^n 
$$
**Properties:**
+ $Dom = \mathbb{R}$

**Theorems:**

> [!NOTE] Odd degree polynomials
> Any odd degree polynomial has **at least one root**

> [!NOTE] Even degree polynomials
> Any even degree polynomial with **positive highest coefficient** is **bounded below.**
