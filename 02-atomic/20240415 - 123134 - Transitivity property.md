> [!NOTE] Property
> For a relation R, we say that it is transitive if: 
> $$
> (v_1 Rv_2)\land(v_2RV_3) \Rightarrow v_1Rv_3
> $$

**Remarks:**
+ This property is called and used in the same way for some other logic relations, whenever we can infer a relation between a and c knowing that a is related to b and b is related to c, then we have transitivity. This property is triangular
