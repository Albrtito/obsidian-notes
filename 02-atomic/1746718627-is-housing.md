### Some important rules:
**Key collection**

- **Keys are delivered to the BN office, which is open every weekday from 10 am to 2 pm. It is not possible to receive keys before the contract takes effect. The apartment is ready after 4 pm on the delivery day.**
- Upon key handover, a handover form for comments will open in the tenant's home area and will remain open for 7 days. All comments will be entered there only. 

**Return to apartment**

- Upon return of the apartment, an inspection is scheduled with the caretaker and will take place in the apartment. All keys must also be handed over at that time. 
- After the return, you can request the return of the guarantee. If the renter had a bank guarantee, you must send an email to bn@bn.is with your name, ID number and address and request the cancellation of the guarantee. If the renter had a deposit, you must send an email to gudrun@bn.is with your bank details to request a refund. 
- The security deposit cannot be refunded/cancelled unless the keys have been returned, the contract has been completed, and the tenant has settled all accounts with BN.
