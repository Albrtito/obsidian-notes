> [!NOTE] Definition 124 
> Given the relation R, transforming the elements of V into elements of W. The inverse relation is the one such as **the same** elements of W are related to the ones form V.
> IF: 
> $$
> R \subseteq V\times W
> $$
> THEN: 
> $$
> R^{-1} = \subseteq W \times V
> $$
> + **Same arrows but in the opposite direction**

**Remark:**
+ The inverse of a relation **always exist**. Remember this is not the case for functions where **for a function to be invertible it needs to be bijective**
**Representations:**
+ For the Vennâ€™s diagram do a mirror image
+ If the relationship is only on one set, then a graph can be created, then in order to create the inverse graph just change all directions 
+ For the **adjacency matrix:**
$$
A_{R^{-1}} = (A_R)^T
$$
