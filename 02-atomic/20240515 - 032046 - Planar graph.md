# Planar graph: 
A planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane. This means that **it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that their edges do not cross each other**. 
The graphical representation of a planar graph is called plane graph. 

## Properties:
### Kuratowsky: 

> [!NOTE] Theorem:
> A graph is planar **if and only if**: 
> + It does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$

### Eulerâ€™s formula:

## Dual graph: 
The dual graph of a plane graph is defined in the following way: 

> [!NOTE] Dual graph definition
> Given a plane connected graph $G=(V, E)$, we can define its dual graph $G^{\star}=\left(V^{\star}, E^{\star}\right)$ in the following way: To each region $f$ of $G$ we associate a dual vertex $f^* \in V^*$, and to each edge $e \in E$,there corresponds a unique dual edge $e^* \in E^*$. If the original edge $e$ is the intersection of two faces $f, h$ (possibly, $f=h$ ), then the corresponding dual edge $e^*$ is incident with the dual vertices $f^*, g^* \in V^*$.
