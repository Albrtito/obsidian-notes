# risk management
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Risk management evaluates and creates solutions for possible risks that a project might face. Management is composed of several actions.

## risk assesment
Risk assesment focuses on getting information. The goal being **prepare yourself**. For this it is foremost important to **discover possible risks** and their importance. 

> A good method for risk discovery is having brainstorming sessions, coming out with as many risk as one can and then later filter them out. 

## risk analysis:
There are several methods for risks analysis, they can be categorithe between being: 
1. **qualitative**
   - Not focusssed on finantials and exact cuatities
   - Easier and quicker to solve
2. **quantitative**:
   - Finantially driven
   - Complex to solve
### qualitative analysis:
We can use a qualitative risk table analysis to find and categorise all possible risks. Inside this analysis we'll find a priority column, we can define priority based on the financial, reputational and legal impact. 

**financial impact**
- **high**: Significant damate  
- **med**: Considerablel damage
- **low**: Limited damage
**reputational impact**: When analysing this it can be a good tool to look at the impact it has over the clients. As they are the ones mostly upholding the reputation. 
**leagal impact**
- **high**: Breaking a lwa

Once we know the impact we need to think about the **probability of it happening**. Usually creating a qualitative risk matrix to analyze in 2D. 
However this model is super simple which is somehting to keep in mind. 
### quantitative analysis:
This is all more exact and value driven, so: 
1. Get the value of all things tangible and intangible, give them a value -> **AV**
2. What is the exposure factor for it, what percentage of it is exposed -> **EF**
3. What happens when the event happens once, single loss expectancy -> **SLE**
   $$
   SLE = AV\times EF
   $$
4. What happens in a year of loses, anual rate of occurrences-> **ARO**
   $$
   ARO = SLE \times Ocurrences
   $$
Based on this ratios we can compare the losses before and after
