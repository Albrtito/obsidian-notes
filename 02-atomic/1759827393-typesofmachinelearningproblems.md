# types of machine learning problems
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> When looking into machine learning we have different types of problems based on the kind of values we have and the ones we are looking for. 

The basic problem model can be defined with an input, model and output.

- **input**-> what values do we give to the model
- **model** -> What function is there that maps input to output
- **output** -> What do we get from the model 

1. **Looking for the model:** Knowing the input and the output. 
   This type of problem appears when we are trying to fit a model to some input and we know what the output should be. Finding classifiers in [[1762634550-supervisedlearning|supervised learning]] for example. (knn, bayes, trees...). 
2. **Looking for the output:** Knowing the input and the model -> **Simulation problems**
   This is just the problem of simulation as the main thing to do is compute and see what the output is. 
   > A traffic simulation for example

3. **Looking for the input:** Knowing the output and the model. -> [[Heuristica y Opti|Heuri]]
   This is heuristics, we have the model and the output we'll try to find the best inputs (or inputs) so that happens. 
   > We can see this clearly in lineal programming problems with some model and output. 
   > $$10x_1 + 20x_2 = 34$$
