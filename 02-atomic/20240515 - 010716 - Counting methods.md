# Counting methods: 
For solving **counting problems**

When computing the possibilities of some event A happening weâ€™ll encounter different types of restrictions for A. Based on these restrictions we can categorise different counting methods to compute the number of possibilities (or cardinality) of some A.
This event A is usually composed by the possibilities of different combinations given some values, length and rules.
