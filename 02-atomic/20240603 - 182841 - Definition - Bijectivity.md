A function f: Aâ†’ B is **bijective** if:
+ It follows [[20240603 - 181804 - Definition - Injectivity|Injectivity]]
+ And also [[20240603 - 182102 - Definition - Surjectivity|Surjectivity]]

This means that if for each point in B a horizontal line was traced. Each of those lines **must intersect exactly once in the graph of the function**

f.e: 
$$
f(x) = x^3
$$ 
+ Is bijective

**Remarks:**
+ Observe that if f is bijective then it **must be either increasing or decreasing**
