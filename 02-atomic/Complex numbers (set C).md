# Intro:
The set of complex numbers C is defined in the following way: 
$$
\mathbb{C} = \{a + ib, \text{ with } a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1\}
$$
Based on this definition we obtain elements of the form: 
$$
z = a + bi
$$
+ Complex numbers have a real part (the one without the i) and an imaginary part (the one with the i)
+ i stands for the imaginary unit. Satisfies the property stated above. This means: 
$$
i = \sqrt{-1}
$$
Complex numbers where introduce in order to solve algebraic equations with non real solutions (negative roots)
