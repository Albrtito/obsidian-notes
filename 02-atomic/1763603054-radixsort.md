# radix sort
> [!info] Intro: 
> Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that applies several times [[1763604604-bucketsort|bucket sort]] in order to to sort **positive integers** (maybe sometimnes floats, but that requires a trick). 

>[!attention] Remarks:
> - Even faster than MergeSort and Quicksort once the threshold of min number of buckets is reached

The video linked [[#Down|below]] is pretty nice and explains everything super good, I'll try to summarize. 

Bucket sort sorts for n categories, if we then have n positive integers, then there is n categories. So because it first need to go though all integers, then through all buckets. The complexity is O(n+n) = O(2n). If the number of integers to sort is huge (lets say $2^{32}$)
