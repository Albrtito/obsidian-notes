# line equation
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Equations for a line given whatever

## slope: 
The slope defines how much y changes for each step of x. It is, by this definition, the rate of change between the y’s of two point given their x’s. 
$$
\begin{align*}
A &= (x_1, y_1)\\
B &= (x_2,y_2)\\\\
m &= \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1-x_2}
\end{align*}
$$
## Point-slope formula: 
$$
y-y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$
given: 
- A point and the slope
- If you have two points
